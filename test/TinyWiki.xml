{{Unreferenced|date=May 2010}}'''Macro-historical''' analysis seeks out large, long-term trends in world history, searching for ultimate patterns through a comparison of proximate details. For example, a macro-historical study might examine Japanese feudalism and European [[feudalism]] in order to decide whether feudal structures are an inevitable outcome given certain conditions. Macro-historical studies often &quot;assume that macro-historical processes repeat themselves in explainable and understandable ways&quot;.[http://parallelism.org/13949-WELL-layout2.pdf]

==History==
Examples of macro-historical analysis include [[Karl Marx]]'s assertion that all history can be explained through [[economics]] and [[class struggle]], and [[Arnold J. Toynbee]]'s historical synthesis in explaining the rise and fall of civilizations. [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] which is considered by many historians to be of great macro-historical importance, as it marked the highwater point of Mongol conquests, and the first time they had ever been decisively defeated.

Another example is the [[Battle of Bannockburn]], (June 23?24, 1314), decisive battle in Scottish history, whereby the Scots under Robert the Bruce defeated the English under Edward II, regained their independence, and established Bruce on his throne as Robert I. The Scottish victory was complete and, although full English recognition of Scottish independence was not achieved until more than ten years later, Robert Bruce's position as king was greatly strengthened by the outcome.

Anatopism
</title>

<text>
An '''anatopism''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''???'', &quot;against,&quot; and ''?????'', &quot;place&quot;) is something that is out of its proper place.  Thus, for example, an [[outrigger canoe]] would be an anatopism in [[ancient Rome]].The [[concept]] of anatopism is less widely familiar than that of [[anachronism]], perhaps because much that is anatopistic is also anachronistic.  Yet the distinction is a valid one; not all that is anatopistic is necessarily also anachronistic.

==Examples==
[[Catherine Hardwicke]]'s 2006 film, ''[[The Nativity Story]]'', shows a field of [[maize]] corn in a [[Nazareth]] farming scene.  Maize is native to [[Mesoamerica]], not to the [[Middle East]], and in [[pre-Columbian]] times was grown only in the [[Americas]].  The use of maize in this film is clearly an anatopism.

The [[Poland|Polish]] writer [[Boles?aw Prus]], for the sake of making a point, introduces into chapter 63 of his [[historical novel]] ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', set in the [[ancient Egypt]] of 1087?1085 BCE, a substance that behaves like [[gunpowder]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Boles?aw Prus]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', pp. 579-81.&lt;/ref&gt;  This appears to be both an anachronism and an anatopism, since gunpowder is thought to have been invented, some time later, in [[China]] or in [[Arab world|Arabia]].  Another apparent anatopism introduced by the author (in chapter 45) is an object that resembles a [[telescope]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Boles?aw Prus]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt; that may also be an [[anachronism]].

Historicity (philosophy)
</title>

<text>
'''Historicity''' in [[philosophy]] is the underlying concept of [[history]], or the intersection of [[teleology]] (the concept and study of progress and purpose), [[temporality]] (the concept of time), and [[historiography]] ([[semiotics]] and history of [[history]]). Varying conceptualizations of historicity emphasize linear progress or the repetition or modulation of past events.== Concepts of historicity ==
In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], historicity is the history of constitution of any [[intentionality|intentional]] object, both in the sense of history as [[tradition]] and in the sense where every individual has its own history. Of course, these two senses are often very similar: One individual's history is heavily influenced by the tradition the individual is formed in, but personal history can also produce an object that wouldn't be a part of any tradition. In addition, personal historicity doesn't develop in the same way as tradition.

[[Martin Heidegger]] argued in ''[[Being and Time]]'' that it is temporality that gives rise to history.  All things have their place and time, and nothing past is outside of history.

[[Francis Fukuyama]] in ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' famously argued that the collapse of [[Soviet communism]] brought humanity to the &quot;end of history&quot; whereby the world's global dialectical machinations had been resolved with the triumph of liberal capitalism.

Before Fukuyama, [[Jean Baudrillard]] argued for a different concept of the &quot;end of history&quot;. Baudrillard's most in-depth writings on the notion of historicity are found in the books ''Fatal Strategies'' and ''The Illusion of the End''. It is for these writings that he received a full-chapter denunciation from the physicist [[Alan Sokal]] (along with [[Jean Bricmont]]), due to his alleged misuse of physical concepts of linear time, space and stability. In contrast to Fukuyama's argument, Baudrillard maintained that the &quot;end of history&quot;, in terms of a [[teleology|teleological]] goal, had always been an illusion brought about by modernity's will towards progress, civilization and rational unification. And this was an illusion that to all intents and purposes vanished toward the end of the 20th century, brought about by the &quot;speed&quot; at which society moved, effectively 'destabilising' the linear progression of history (it is these comments, specifically, that provoked Sokal's criticism). History was, so to speak, outpaced by its own spectacular realisation. As Baudrillard himself caustically put it:

:''The end of history is, alas, also the end of the dustbins of history. There are no longer any dustbins for disposing of old ideologies, old regimes, old values. Where are we going to throw Marxism, which actually invented the dustbins of history? (Yet there is some justice here since the very people who invented them have fallen in.) Conclusion: if there are no more dustbins of history,'' this is because History itself has become a dustbin. ''It has become its own dustbin, just as the planet itself is becoming its own dustbin.''&lt;ref&gt;''The Illusion of the End'', or ''Selected Writings'', p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach to history is what marks out Baudrillard's affinities with the [[postmodernism|postmodern]] philosophy of [[Jean-Fran?ois Lyotard]]: the idea that society ? and Western society in particular ? has 'dropped out' of the grand narratives of history (for example the coming of Communism or the triumph of civilized modern society). But Baudrillard has supplemented this argument by contending that, although this 'dropping out' may have taken place, the global world (which in Baudrillard's writing is sharply distinct from a [[universal humanity]]) is, in accordance with its spectacular understanding of itself, condemned to 'play out' this illusory ending in a hyper-teleological way ? acting out the end of the end of the end, ''ad infinitum''. Thus Baudrillard argues that ? in a manner similar to [[Giorgio Agamben]]'s book ''Means without Ends'' ? Western society is subject to the political restriction of means that are justified by ends that do not exist.

[[Michel-Rolph Trouillot]] offers a different insight into the meaning and uses of Historicity. Trouillot explains that &quot;The ways in which what happened,and what is said to have happened are and are not the same may itself be historical&quot;.

{{For|[[Isaac Asimov]]'s use of the term in science fiction|psychohistory (fictional)}}'''Psychohistory''' is the study of the psychological motivations of historical events.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119612862/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0&lt;/ref&gt; It attempts to combine the insights of [[psychotherapy]] with the research methodology of the [[social sciences]] to understand the emotional origin of the social and [[political]] behavior of groups and nations, past and present. Its subject matter is childhood and the [[family]] (especially [[child abuse]]), and psychological studies of [[anthropology]] and [[ethnology]].
==Description==
[[Image:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 035.jpg|thumb|right|Rembrandt's painting of the sacrifice of Isaac, from the Old Testament.]]

Psychohistory derives many of its concepts from areas that are perceived to be ignored by conventional historians as shaping factors of human history, in particular, the effects of [[childbirth]], [[parenting]] practice, and child abuse.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The historical impact of [[incest]], [[infanticide]] and [[child sacrifice]] are considered. Psychohistory holds that human societies can change between infanticidal and non-infanticidal practices and has coined the term &quot;[[early infanticidal childrearing]]&quot; to describe abuse and neglect observed by many anthropologists. [[Lloyd deMause]], the pioneer of psychohistory, has described a system of psychogenic modes (see below) which describe the range of styles of parenting he has observed historically and across cultures.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}
Many anthropologists concur that &quot;the science of culture is independent of the laws of [[biology]] and [[psychology]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Psychohistory relies heavily on historical biography. Notable examples of [[psychobiography|psychobiographies]] are those of [[Lewis Bernstein Namier|Lewis Namier]], who wrote about the [[British House of Commons]], and [[Fawn Brodie]], who wrote about [[Thomas Jefferson]].

Science fiction author and scientist/science writer [[Isaac Asimov]] popularized the term in his famous [[Foundation series]] of novels, though in his works the term is used fictionally for a mathematical discipline that can be used to predict the general course of future history.

===Areas of psychohistorical study===
There are three inter-related areas of psychohistorical study.&lt;ref name=&quot;Primalpages&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://primal-page.com/psyhis.htm |title=Lloyd deMause and Psychohistory |accessdate=2008-03-11 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=Primal Psychotherapy WebPages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''' 1.- The History of Childhood''' - which looks at such questions as:
*How have children been raised throughout history
*How has the family been constituted
*How and why have practices changed over time
*The changing place and value of children in society over time
*How and why our views of child abuse and neglect have changed

'''2.- [[Psychobiography]]''' - which  seeks to understand individual historical people and their motivations in history.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

'''3.- Group Psychohistory''' - which  seeks to understand the motivations of large groups, including nations, in history and current affairs.  In doing so, psychohistory advances the use of group-fantasy analysis of political speeches, political cartoons and media headlines since the fantasy words therein offer clues to unconscious thinking and behaviors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Primalpages&quot;/&gt;

===Emergence as a discipline===
[[Sigmund Freud]]'s well known work, ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' (1929), included an analysis of history based on his theory of psychoanalysis. Yet, Freud's text is in no way a psycho-historical work since the focus of the study is to move beyond the level of individual psyche to explain the influence of the structures of civilization. Rather, Freud's work is the opposite of psycho-history that claims that the unconscious and the individual psyche are both structural effects of different social forces.

[[Wilhelm Reich]] combined his psychoanalytic and political theories in his book ''[[The Mass Psychology of Fascism]]'' in 1933.

The psychologist and philosopher [[Erich Fromm]] wrote about the psychological motivation behind political ideology, starting with ''[[The Fear of Freedom]]'' in 1941.

Another member of the Frankfurt school, [[Theodor Adorno]], published [[The Authoritarian Personality]], in 1950, which was an influential sociological book which could be taken as something of a proto-psychohistorical book.

Its first academic use appeared in [[Erik Erikson]]'s book ''Young Man Luther'' (1958), where the author called for a discipline of &quot;psycho-history&quot; to examine the impact of human character on history.

[[Lloyd deMause]] developed a formal psychohistorical approach from 1974 onwards, and continues to be an influential theorist in this field.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Independence as a discipline===

DeMause and others have argued that psychohistory is a separate field of scholarly inquiry with its own particular methods, objectives and theories, which set it apart from conventional historical analysis and anthropology. Some historians, social scientists and anthropologists have, however, argued that their disciplines already describe psychological motivation and that Psychohistory is not, therefore, a separate subject.  Others have dismissed deMause's theories and motives arguing that the emphasis given by Psychohistory to speculation on the psychological motivations of people in history make it an undisciplined field of study. Doubt has also been cast on the viability of the application of post-mortem psychoanalysis by Freud's followers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/shrinking-history/] Review of ''Shrinking History on Freud and the Failure of Psychohistory'' - Reviewed in 1980 by Cosma Shalizi
:'''Note:''' The book under review criticizes the Freudian approach to psychohistory. It makes no mention of deMause or The Institute for Psychohistory.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychohistorians maintain that the difference is one of emphasis and that, in conventional study, narrative and description are central, while psychological motivation is hardly touched on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| last = Davis
| first = Glenn
| title = Childhood and History in America
| publisher = Psychohistory Pr
| year = 1976
| location = NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; For deMause, child abuse takes the center stage. Psychohistorians accuse most anthropologists and ethnologists of being apologists for incest, infanticide, [[cannibalism]] and child sacrifice.&lt;ref name=&quot;OnWriting&quot;&gt;{{cite journal  | last = deMause  | first = Lloyd  | title = On Writing Childhood History  | journal = The Journal of Psychohistory  | volume = 16 (2) Fall  | year = 1988 | url = http://www.psychohistory.com/childhood/writech1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; They maintain that what constitutes child abuse is a matter of objective fact, and that some of the practices which mainstream anthropologists apologize for (e.g., sacrificial rituals) may result in [[psychosis]], dissociation and magical thinking: particularly for the surviving children who had a sacrificed brother or sister by their parents. In a 1994 interview with deMause in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', the interviewer wrote: &quot;To buy into psychohistory, you have to subscribe to some fairly woolly assumptions [...], for instance, that a nations's child-rearing techniques affect its foreign policy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The talk of the town&quot;, ''[[The New Yorker]]'', authored by Editors of the periodical (December 5, 1994), pp. 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychohistorians also believe that [[cultural relativism]] is contrary to the letter and spirit of [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Psychogenic mode==
Psychohistorians have written much about changes in the human psyche through history; changes that they believe were produced by parents, and especially the mothers' increasing capacity to empathize with their children. Key to deMause's thought is the concept of psychoclass, which emerges out of a particular style of childrearing, and child abuse, at a particular period in a society's development. The conflict of new and old psychoclasses is also highlighted in psychohistorians' thought. This is reflected, for instance, in the clash between [[Democratic party (United States)|Blue State]] and [[Republican party (United States)|Red State]] voters in the contemporary United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dervin | first = Dan | title = George W. Bush's Second Term: Saving the World, Saving the Country | journal = [[Journal of Psychohistory|The Journal of Psychohistory]] | volume = 33 | pages = 117?124 | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = deMause | first = Lloyd | title = [Book review of] Jonathan Schell's ''The Seventh Decade'' | journal = The Journal of Psychohistory | volume = 35 | pages = 308?309 | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another key psychohistorical concept is that of ''group fantasy'', which deMause regards as a mediating force between a psychoclass's collective childhood experiences (and the psychic conflicts emerging therefrom), and the psychoclass's behavior in politics, religion and other aspects of social life.&lt;ref name=&quot;EMOL&quot;&gt;{{cite book

| pages = 104?109, 391, 430ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''psychogenic mode'' in Psychohistory is a type of mentality (or ''psychoclass'') that results from, and is associated with, a particular childrearing style. The major psychogenic modes described by deMause are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20091026212029/http://www.geocities.com/kidhistory/modesw.htm ''The Evolution of Childrearing Modes'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PsFoundations&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=deMause |first=Lloyd  |authorlink=Lloyd deMause|title=Foundations of Psychohistory |url= |edition= |series= |date= |year=1982 |month=January  |publisher=Creative Roots Publishing  |location= |isbn=094050801X |oclc= |doi=  |pages=61 &amp; 132?146}}[http://www.psychohistory.com/htm/p132x146.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td rowspan=&quot;2&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Infanticidal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;''[[Early infanticidal childrearing]]:''&lt;br /&gt;Ritual sacrifice. High infanticide rates, incest, body mutilation, child rape and tortures.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td rowspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;[[Child sacrifice]] and [[infanticide]] among tribal societies, [[Child sacrifice in pre-Columbian cultures|Mesoamerica and the Incas]]; in [[Assyria]]n and [[Canaan]]ite religions. [[Human_sacrifice#Phoenicia|Phoenicians, Carthaginians]] and other early states also sacrificed infants to their gods.

On the other hand, the relatively more enlightened Greeks and Romans exposed some of their babies (&quot;late&quot; infanticidal childrearing).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;''Late infanticidal childrearing:''&lt;br /&gt;While the young child is not overly rejected by the mother, many newborn babies, especially girls, are [[Child abandonment|exposed]] to death.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Abandoning&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Early Christians considered a child as having a soul at birth, although possessed by evil tendencies. Routine infanticide was replaced by joining in the group fantasy of the sacrifice of Christ, who was sent by his father to be killed for the sins of others.&lt;ref name=&quot;PsFoundations&quot; /&gt; Routine pederasty of boys continued in monasteries and elsewhere, and the rape of girls was commonplace.&lt;ref name=&quot;EMOL&quot; /&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Infanticide replaced by abandonment. Those children who survived the experience did not internalize a completely murderous superego. Longer [[swaddling]], [[fosterage]], outside [[Wet nurse|wetnursing]], oblation of children to monasteries and nunneries, and [[apprenticeship]].&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Ambivalent&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;The 12th century saw the first child instruction manuals and rudimentary child protection laws, although most mothers still emotionally rejected their children.&lt;ref name=&quot;PsFoundations&quot; /&gt;  Children were often treated as erotic objects by adults.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;The later Middle Ages ended abandonment of children to monasteries. [[Enema]]s, early beating, shorter swaddling, mourning for deceased children, a precursor to [[empathy]].&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Intrusive&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;During the 16th century, particularly in England, parents shifted from trying to stop children's growth to trying to control them and make them obedient. Parents were prepared to give them attention as long as they controlled their minds, their insides, their anger and the lives they led.&lt;ref name=&quot;PsFoundations&quot; /&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;The intrusive parent began to unswaddle the infant. Early toilet training, [[Psychological repression|repression]] of child's sexuality. [[Hell]] threats turned into the Puritan child so familiar from early modern childrearing literature. On the other hand, the end of swaddling and wet-nursing made possible the explosive modern takeoff in scientific advance.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Socializing&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Beginning in the 18th century, mothers began to actually enjoy child care, and fathers began to participate in younger children's development.&lt;ref name=&quot;PsFoundations&quot; /&gt; The aim remained instilling parental goals rather than encouraging individuation. [[Psychological manipulation]] and [[spanking]] were used to make children obedient. Hellfire and the harsher physical disciplinary actions using objects to beat the child disappeared.&lt;ref name=&quot;PsFoundations&quot; /&gt;  The Socializing Mode remains the most popular model of parenting in North America and Western Europe to the present day.  &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Use of guilt, &quot;mental discipline&quot;, [[humiliation]], rise of [[Compulsory education|compulsory schooling]], delegation of parental unconscious wishes. As parental injections continued to diminish, the rearing of the child became less a process of conquering its will than of training it. The socializing psychoclass built the modern world.&lt;ref name=&quot;PsFoundations&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Helping&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Beginning in the mid-20th century, some parents adopted the role of helping children reach their own goals in life, rather than &quot;[[socialize]]&quot; them into fulfilling parental wishes. Less psychological manipulation, more unconditional love. Children raised in this way are far more empathic towards others in society than earlier generations.&lt;ref name=&quot;PsFoundations&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;[[Children's rights movement]], [[deschooling]] and [[Anarchistic free school|free schooling]], [[natural childbirth]], [[Taking Children Seriously]] and the abandonment of [[circumcision]].&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Psychohistorians maintain that the six modes of abusive childrearing (excluding the &quot;helping mode&quot;) are [[Trauma model of mental disorders#Psychohistory table|related to psychiatric disorders]] from psychoses to neuroses.

The chart below shows the dates at which these modes are believed to have evolved in the most advanced nations, based on contemporary accounts from historical records. A black-and-white version of the chart appears in ''Foundations of Psychohistory''.&lt;ref name=&quot;PsFoundations&quot; /&gt;&lt;!-- p. 61 --&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Image-Evolution of psychogenic modes.png|centre]]

The timeline doesn't apply to [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. It doesn't apply either to the [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Rome|Roman]] world, where there was a wide variation in childrearing practices. It is notable that the arrival of the ''Ambivalent'' mode of child-rearing preceded the start of the [[Renaissance]] (mid 14th century) by only one or two generations, and the arrival of the ''Socializing'' mode coincided with the [[Age of Enlightenment]], which began in the late 18th century.

''Population Studies, 53 (1),'' 49-61.&lt;/ref&gt; From the psychohistorical view, this demonstrates that the earlier forms of childrearing coexist with later modes, even in the most advanced countries. However, the chart should not be regarded as an accurate representation of the relative prevalence of each mode in the present day, as it is not based on large-scale, formal surveys.

According to psychohistory theory, each of the six psychoclasses co-exists in the [[modern world]] today, and, regardless of the changes in the environment, it is only when changes in childhood occur that societies begin to progress.

The Y-Axis on the above chart serves as an indicator of the new stage and not a measurement of the stage's size or relation to the x-axis.

===A psychoclass for postmodern times===

According to the psychogenic theory, since [[Neanderthal man]] most tribes and families practiced infanticide, child mutilation, incest and beating of their children throughout prehistory and history.  Presently the Western socializing mode of childrearing is considered much less abusive in the field, though this mode is not yet entirely free of abuse. In the opening paragraph of his seminal essay &quot;The Evolution of Childhood&quot; (first article in ''The History of Childhood''), DeMause states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The history of childhood is a nightmare from which we have only recently begun to awaken.  The further back in history one goes, the lower the level of childcare, and the more likely children are to be killed, abandoned, beaten, terrorized and sexually abused.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is notwithstanding an optimistic trait in the field. In a world of &quot;helping mode&quot; parents, deMause believes, violence of any other sort will disappear as well, along with [[magical thinking]], mental disorders, wars and other inhumanities of man against man. Although, the criticism has been made that this itself is a form of magical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://primal-page.com/ps4.htm The evolution of psyche and society] - deMause's explanatory chapter of ''The Emotional Life of Nations'' (op. cit.).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
There are no departments dedicated to &quot;psychohistory&quot; in any institution of higher learning, though some history departments have run courses in it. Psychohistory remains a [[Controversy|controversial]] field of study, and deMause and other psychohistorians face criticism in the academic community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Stannard, David E. |title=Shrinking History: On Freud and the Failure of Psychohistory |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |location= |year=1982 |pages= |isbn=0-19-503044-3 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eysenck |first=Hans Jurgen |authorlink= Hans Eysenck |title=Decline and Fall of the Freudian Empire |url=http://books.google.com/?id=oFbO0EDgBikC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=anthropology+psychohistory |accessdate= |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=0765809451 |chapter=7 Psycho-babble and Pseudo-History |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pomper |first=Philip  |year=1973 |title=Problems of a Naturalistic Psychohistory  |journal=History and Theory |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=367?388 |doi=10.2307/2504699|jstor=2504699}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hunt |first=Lynn |editor=Kramer Lloyd S. and Maza, Sarah C.|title=A Companion to Western Historical Thought |url=http://books.google.com/?id=E2eKDjo4B_IC&amp;pg=PA339&amp;lpg=PA339&amp;dq=psychohistory+is+a+pseudoscience |year=2002 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn=0631217142 |pages=337?357 |chapter=Psychology, Pschoanalysis and Historical Thought -The Misfortunes of Psychohistory }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Paul  | first = Robert A.  | title = Review of Lloyd deMause's Foundations of Psychohistory  | journal = Journal of Psychoanalytic Anthropology  | volume = 5  | pages = 469  | year = 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeMause's formulations have been criticized for being insufficiently supported by credible research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Demos  | first = John  | title = &quot;Child Abuse in Context: An Historian's Perspective&quot;.

The discipline has the advantage of being able to deal with [[Motivation|motive]] in history and is useful in developing narratives, but is forced to psychoanalyse its subjects after the fact, which was not considered when the theory was developed and expanded.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Recent psychohistory has also been criticized for being overly-entangled with DeMause, whose theories do not speak for the entire field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ids.net/~marcom/historint/hi-methodnotes.html   |title=Historical Sources On Line - A weblography  of  Historical Sources on the Internet |accessdate=March 2008 |author=Marc Comtois }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1974 book in which deMause included essays of nine professional historians, ''The History of Childhood'', offers a survey of the treatment of children through history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=DeMause L | authorlink = Lloyd deMause |title=The History of Childhood (The Master Work) |publisher=Jason Aronson |location=Northvale, N.J |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=1-56821-551-7 |oclc= |doi=| coauthors = Lyman RB, McLaughlin, MM et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although critics generally spare these nine historians, they see deMause as a strong proponent of the &quot;black legend&quot; view of childhood history (i.e. that the history of childhood was above all a history of progress, with children being far more often badly mistreated in the past).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Aries  | first = Philippe  | title = De l'enfant roi a l'enfant martyr  | journal = Revue Psychologie  | volume = 68  | pages = 6  | year = 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, his work has been criticized for being a history of child abuse, not childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Heywood  | first = Colin  | title = A History of Childhood  | publisher = Polity Press  | year = 2001  | location = Cambridge  | pages = 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The History of Childhood'', authored by ten scholars (including deMause), is often linked to Edward Shorter's ''The Making of the Modern Family'' and [[Lawrence Stone]]'s ''The Family, Sex and Marriage in England 1500-1800'', because of the common ground they share in agreeing with a grim perspective of childhood history. But deMause's work in particular has attracted hostility from historian Hugh Cunningham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cunningham  | first = Hugh  | title = Children and Childhood in Western Society since 1500  | publisher = Longman | year = 1995 | location = London  | pages = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Kohut went even further:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The reader is doubtless already familiar with examples of these psychohistorical &quot;abuses.&quot; There is a significant difference, however, between the well-meaning and serious, if perhaps simplistic and reductionistic, attempt to understand the psychological in history and the psychohistorical expose that can at times verge on historical pornography. For examples of the more frivolous and distasteful sort of psychohistory, see ''[[The Journal of Psychohistory]]''. For more serious and scholarly attempts to understand the psychological dimension of the past, see ''The Psychohistory Review''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Kohut  | first = Thomas A.  | title = Psychohistory as History  | jstor = 1858137  | journal = The American Historical Review  | volume = 91  | issue = 2  | pages = 336?354  | year = 1986  | doi = 10.2307/1858137  | pmid = 11611943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

DeMause and the psychohistorians respond that their detractors are not largely moved by evidence, but rather are unconsciously motivated to attack those who would challenge the idea of &quot;good parenting&quot; even in very primitive tribes or cultures.&lt;ref name=&quot;OnWriting&quot;/&gt;

==Organizations==
The principal center for psychohistorical study is The Institute for Psychohistory founded by Lloyd deMause which has 19 branches around the globe and has for over 30 years published the ''[[Journal of Psychohistory|The Journal of Psychohistory]]''.

The International Psychohistorical Association founded by [[Lloyd deMause]] in 1977 is the professional organization for the field of psychohistory. It publishes ''Psychohistory News'' and has a psychohistorical mail order lending library. It hosts an annual convention.

A course in Psychohistory has been taught at a three universities at the undergraduate level. The following have published course details: [[Boston University]], [[City University of New York]] and [[Wesleyan University]].&lt;ref&gt;Boston University has a Psychohistory Course.

Parachronism

<text>
{{unreferenced|date=May 2009}}A '''parachronism''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] &quot;''????'',&quot; &quot;on the side,&quot; and &quot;''??????'',&quot; &quot;time&quot;) is anything that appears in a [[Time|temporal]] context (time period) in which, though not sufficiently out of place as to be impossible, it is not normally found. The item is often an object, but may be an idiomatic expression, a technology, a philosophical idea, a musical style, a material, a custom, or anything else sufficiently closely bound to a particular period as to seem strange when encountered in a later era.
Parachronisms are objects or ideas which were once common, but are now considered rare or inappropriate. They often take the form of obsolete technology or outdated fashion. This is different from a [[prochronism]], in which the object or idea has not yet been invented when the situation takes place, and therefore could not have existed at the time. Thus a suburban housewife in the United States around 1960 would not ordinarily use a [[washboard]] for laundry after [[washing machine]]s had become the norm, and few teenagers of that time would be listening to [[ragtime]] music.

'''Chronology''' (from [[Latin]] ''chronologia'', from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:??????|??????]]}}, ''chronos'', &quot;time&quot;; and {{lang|grc|-?????}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'') is the science of arranging events in their order of occurrence in [[time]], such as the use of a [[timeline]] or [[sequence of events]]. It is also &quot;the determination of the actual temporal sequence of past events&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wordnet&quot;&gt;Memidex/WordNet, &quot;chronology,&quot; [http://www.memidex.com/chronology+humanistic-discipline memidex.com] (accessed September 25, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronology is part of [[periodization]]. It is also part of the discipline of [[history]], including [[earth history]], the [[earth sciences]], and study of the [[geologic time scale]] (see [[#Prehistoric chronologies|Prehistoric chronologies]] below).

==Related fields==
Chronology is the science of locating historical events in time, basically a time line and is distinct from, but relies upon [[chronometry]] or timekeeping, and [[historiography]], which examines the writing of history and the use of historical methods. [[Radiocarbon dating]] estimates the age of formerly living things by measuring the proportion of [[carbon-14]] [[isotope]] in their [[carbon]] content. [[Dendrochronology]] estimates the age of trees by [[correlation]] of the various [[growth rings]] in their wood to known year-by-year reference sequences in the region to reflect year-to-year climatic variation. Dendrochronology is used in turn as a [[calibration]] reference for [[radiocarbon dating]] curves.

==Calendar and era==
{{calendars}}
{{Main|Calendar}}
The familiar terms ''[[calendar]]'' and ''[[era]]'' (within the meaning of a coherent system of numbered calendar years) concern two complementary fundamental concepts of chronology. For example during eight centuries the calendar belonging to the [[Christian era]], which era was taken in use in the eighth century by [[Bede]], was the Julian calendar, but after the year 1582 it was the Gregorian calendar. [[Dionysius Exiguus]] (about the year 500) was the founder of that era, which is nowadays the most widespread dating system on earth.

===Ab Urbe condita era===
{{Main|Ab urbe condita}}
''Ab Urbe condita'' is [[Latin]] for &quot;from [[founding of Rome|the founding]] of the City ([[Rome]])&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Literally translated as &quot;From the city having been founded&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; traditionally set in 753 BC. It was used to identify the Roman year by a few Roman historians. Modern historians use it much more frequently than the Romans themselves did; the dominant method of identifying Roman years was to name the two [[consul]]s who held office that year. Before the advent of the modern critical edition of historical Roman works, AUC was indiscriminately added to them by earlier editors, making it appear more widely used than it actually was.

It was used systematically for the first time only about the year 400, by the Iberian historian [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]. [[Pope Boniface IV]], in about the year 600, seems to have been the first who made a connection between these this era and [[Anno Domini]]. (AD 1 = AUC 754.)

===Astronomical era===
{{Main|Astronomical year numbering}}
Dionysius Exiguus? Anno Domini era (which contains only calendar years ''AD'') was extended by [[Bede]] to the complete [[Christian]] era (which contains, in addition all calendar years ''BC'', but no ''year zero''). Ten centuries after Bede, the French astronomers [[La Hire|Philippe de la Hire]] (in the year 1702) and [[Jacques Cassini]] (in the year 1740), purely to simplify certain calculations, put the [[Julian Date|Julian Dating System]] (proposed in the year 1583 by [[Joseph Scaliger]]) and with it an astronomical era into use, which contains a [[leap year]] zero, which precedes the year 1 (AD) but does not exactly coincide with the year 1 BC. Astronomers never preposed seriously to replace our era with their astronomical era (which for that matter coincides exactly with the Christian era where it concerns the calendar years ''after'' the year 4).

==Prehistoric chronologies==
While of critical importance to the historian, methods of determining chronology are used in most disciplines of science, especially [[astronomy]], [[geology]], [[paleontology]] and [[archaeology]].

In the absence of [[written history]], with its [[chronicle]]s and [[:Category:King lists|king list]]s, late 19th century archaeologists found that they could develop relative chronologies based on pottery techniques and styles. In the field of [[Egyptology]], [[William Flinders Petrie]] pioneered sequence dating to penetrate pre-dynastic [[Neolithic]] times, using groups of contemporary artefacts deposited together at a single time in graves and working backwards methodically from the earliest historical phases of Egypt. This method of dating is known as [[Seriation (archaeology)|seriation]].

Known wares discovered at strata in sometimes quite distant sites, the product of trade, helped extend the network of chronologies. Some cultures have retained the name applied to them in reference to characteristic forms, for lack of an idea of what they called themselves: &quot;The [[Beaker People]]&quot; in northern Europe during the [[3rd millennium BCE]], for example. The study of the means of placing pottery and other cultural artifacts into some kind of order proceeds in two phases, classification and typology: Classification creates categories for the purposes of description, and typology seeks to identify and analyse changes that allow artifacts to be placed into sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Greene | first =Kevin | authorlink = | title =Archaeology : An Introduction | publisher =University of Newcastle Upon Tyne | month =November | year =2007 | location = | pages = Chapter 4 | url =http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/kevin.greene/wintro/chap4.htm | isbn = | accessdate =2008-01-04 | nopp =true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laboratory techniques developed particularly after mid-20th century helped constantly revise and refine the chronologies developed for specific cultural areas. Unrelated dating methods help reinforce a chronology, an axiom of corroborative [[evidence]]. Ideally, archaeological materials used for dating a site should complement each other and provide a means of cross-checking. Conclusions drawn from just one unsupported technique are usually regarded as unreliable.

==Chronological analysis==
Several legendary sources tend to assign unrealistically long lifespans to pre-historical heroes and monarchs (''e.g.'', Egyptian, Chinese, Hebrews, Japanese), if the number of years there reported are understood as years of more than 340 days. Though chronologies formulated before the 1960s are subject to serious skepticism today, more recent results are more robust than readily appears to journalists and enthusiastic amateurs. [[Bayesian inference]] can be applied in the analysis of chronological information, including radiocarbon-derived dates.

It has since been used in both the direct and the ironic sense in political and nonpolitical contexts.

Later, it was most notably used by [[Ronald Reagan]] in a speech to the [[British House of Commons]] on June 8, 1982.  Reagan's speechwriter chose the expression deliberately because of its prior context. His exact phrase was: &quot;... freedom and democracy will leave [[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]] on the ash heap of history.&quot;

A '''memory hole''' is any mechanism for the alteration or disappearance of inconvenient or embarrassing documents, photographs, transcripts, or other records, such as from a [[web site]] or other archive, particularly as part of an attempt to give the impression that something never happened.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy&quot;&gt;[http://firedoglake.com/2010/05/31/memorial-day-memory-hole-after-israel-forgets-exodus-white-house-forgets-shores-of-tripoli-will-obama-remember-nato/ Murphy, Kirk, ''Memorial Day Memory Hole: After Israel Forgets ?Exodus?, White House Forgets ?Shores of Tripoli?. Will Obama Remember NATO?''  May 31, 2010 [[Firedoglake]].com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mother&quot;&gt;[http://motherjones.com/mojo/2010/06/nevada-tea-partier-memory-hole-website-sharron-angle-harry-reid-senate Weinstein, Adam, ''Nevada Tea Partier's Memory Hole'' June 9, 2010]. [[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]].&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was first popularized by [[George Orwell]]'s [[dystopian]] novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.

==Origins==
In ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' the memory hole is a small chute leading to a large [[incinerator]] used for [[censorship]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newspeakdictionary.com/ns-dict.html &quot;Memory Hole&quot;, the Newspeak Dictionary.]&lt;/ref&gt;:

{{quote|In the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices. To the right of the speakwrite, a small [[pneumatic tube]] for written messages, to the left, a larger one for newspapers; and in the side wall, within easy reach of Winston's arm, a large oblong slit protected by a wire grating. This last was for the disposal of waste paper. Similar slits existed in thousands or tens of thousands throughout the building, not only in every room but at short intervals in every corridor. For some reason they were nicknamed memory holes. When one knew that any document was due for destruction, or even when one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about, it was an automatic action to lift the flap of the nearest memory hole and drop it in, whereupon it would be whirled away on a current of warm air to the enormous furnaces which were hidden somewhere in the recesses of the building.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the novel, the memory hole is a slot into which government officials deposit politically inconvenient documents and records to be destroyed. ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'''s protagonist [[Winston Smith]], who works in the [[Ministry of Truth]], is routinely assigned the task of revising old newspaper articles in order to serve the propaganda interests of the government.

For example, if the government had pledged that the [[chocolate]] [[Rationing|ration]] would not fall below the current 30 [[grams]] per week, but in fact the ration is reduced to 20&amp;nbsp;grams per week, the historical record (for example, an article from a back issue of the ''Times'' newspaper) is revised to contain an announcement that a reduction to 20&amp;nbsp;grams might soon prove necessary, or that the ration, then 15&amp;nbsp;grams, would soon be increased to that number. The original copies of the historical record are deposited into the memory hole.

A document placed in the memory hole is supposedly transported to an incinerator from which &quot;not even the ash remains&quot;. However, as with almost all claims made by the Party in this novel, the truth is left ambiguous and the reader is not told whether the documents are truly destroyed. For example, a photograph which Winston throws into one early in the novel is produced later during his torture session by O'Brien, who then throws it back, moments later denying having any memory that the event had even occurred. This draws a direct parallel with the Party's general philosophy of doublethink, of which the memory hole is in a sense the physical embodiment; as the novel describes it, &quot;to forget, whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again&quot;.

Transformation of culture

</id>
<text>
'''Transformation of culture''', or '''cultural change''',  to the dynamic process whereby the living [[culture]]s of the world are changing and adapting to external or internal forces. This process is occurring within [[Western culture]] as well as non-Western and [[indigenous cultures]] and cultures of the world. Forces which contribute to the cultural change described in this article include: [[colonization]], [[globalization]], advances in [[communication]], [[transport]] and [[infrastructure]] improvements, and [[military]] expansion.==Theories of cultural change==
Various scholars have proposed different theories of cultural change. [[Thomas R. Rochon]] proposed a differentiation between three modes of cultural change:&lt;ref name=Rochon&gt;Thomas R. Rochon, ''Culture Moves: Ideas, Activism, and Changing Values'', Princeton U. Press, 1998, ISBN 0691011575, p.55-56&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''value conversion''' ? the replacement of existing cultural values with new ones (ex. changing views of [[slavery]] as an acceptable practice to an abhorrent one)&lt;ref name=Rochon/&gt;
* '''value creation''' ? the development of new ideas to apply to new situations (ex. emergence of the environmental issues or concepts such as [[sexual harassment]])&lt;ref name=Rochon/&gt;
* '''value connection''' ? the development of a conceptual link between phenomena previously thought unconnected or connected in a different way

== Transformation of Western culture ==
&quot;Western&quot; or [[European culture]] began to undergo rapid change starting with the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] in the [[New World]], and continuing with the [[industrial revolution]]. The [[Modern era|Modern Period]], from 1914?1945, is characterized as a highly transformative era, with [[World War I]] serving as the watershed moment initiating and forever marking the [[Modern]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Professor Robert Hershey, at the [[University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law|James E. Rogers College of Law]] expands on this concept and how it relates to transformation of cultures in his [[globalization]] course.&lt;/ref&gt; In literature, the work of the High [[Modernists]] ruled this period. Notable High Modernists include: [[T.S. Elliot]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Ezra Pound]], and [[James Joyce]]. The High Modernists were predominantly American [[expatriates]] living abroad after the war and strongly marked by the war experience. A great deal of literature was written attempting to convey the [[World War I]] experience. Among these is Ezra Pound's poem, &quot;Hugh Selwyn Mauberley&quot;, published in 1920. The poem points out the perceived pointlessness of World War I, but also the loss of faith in the [[British Empire]] and Western ideals. Another example of literature during this time is the anti-war poem &quot;Dulce et Decorum Est.&quot;, written by [[Wilfred Owen]]. This poem contests the deep-seated tradition of ''noblesse oblige'', and questions the idea of dying for one's country. The 1960s were a tumultuous time in Western culture, especially in Europe due to the severe restructuring necessary following the aftermath of the [[Second World War]] and in the United States due to its controversial participation in both the [[Cold War]] and South East Asian political affairs with the [[Vietnam War]], where the US role was perceived from a numer of directions as prolonging the residual effects of decades of colonial patronization in the Asian region by economically well to do European powers. This period was marked by a number of nascent social changes including a hightened sensitivity to the futility of war which sparked hundreds of protest marches and popular uprisings on a world-wide scale, rising tides of awareness concerning the need to change overwhelmingly negative [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]-relations in the USA, experimental drug use, a new genre in popular music, and a general shift away from social normatives of previous generations. Out of this era stemmed some of today's most powerful forces, such as the internet. The internet was created in large part by people cooperating, taking chances, and experimenting outside of corporate settings. Many of the individuals who were drawn to the technology in its infancy were activists and progressives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= | first= | authorlink= | coauthors= | title= How the 60s Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry | publisher=Penguin Group | year=2005 | location= New York, NY | pages= | url= | doi= | id= | isbn=0670033820}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars and social theorists recognize that we are undergoing another cultural change brought about by the [[New Industrial Revolution]]. This Revolution is changing the way that products are made and disposed of,&lt;ref&gt;[[William McDonough]] &amp; Michael Braungart, ''Cradle to Cradle'' (North Point Press, New York 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; how buildings are constructed, and our relationship to the natural world and its capital.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Hawkins (politician)|Paul Hawkins]], Amory Lovins &amp; L. Hunter Lovins, ''Natural Capitalism'' (Little, Brown and Company, New York 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; See also: [[segregation laws]], [[conscription|conscientious objection]], May 1968.

== Transformation of indigenous cultures ==
Many of the themes discussed in the context of transformation of [[cultures]] and cultural change have particular urgency for the world's [[indigenous peoples]]. Indigenous systems of collective economic production and distribution do
not conform to [[capitalism|capitalism's]] emphasis on individual accumulation. This phenomenon is not new, although processes of [[globalization]] have increased the scale and frequency of such conflicts of perspective. The contradictions between indigenous and capitalist modes of production, and the tensions generated by their intersection, have deep historical roots in the process of [[colonization]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Wolf]] (1982), Europe and the People Without History. Univ. of California Press, LA.&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, the two worldviews are indeed antithetical. Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, an Igorot [[activist]] from the [[Philippines]], summarizes the difference when she writes that &quot;[[industrialized]] [[culture]] regards our [[value (personal and cultural)|values]] as unscientific obstacles to [[modernization]] and thus worthy of ridicule, suppression, and denigration. The [[Industrial Revolution|industrial world]] also views our [[political]], [[social]], and land-tenure [[traditions]] as dangerous: our collective identities; our communal ownership of [[forests]], [[water]]s, and lands; our usufruct system of [[community]] sharing, and our consensus decision-making are all antithetical to the capitalist hallmarks of individualism and private [[property]].&quot; &lt;ref&gt;from &quot;Our Right to Remain Separate and Distinct&quot; In PARADIGM WARS: INDIGENOUS PEOPLES' RESISTANCE TO ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION (hereafter &quot;PARADIGM WARS&quot;) 10-11. (Jerry Mander and Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, eds., 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Many indigenous peoples view &quot;[[resources]]&quot; in a very different way from that of global industry's [[commodity]]-centered calculus. A leader of the Indigenous Network on Economies and Trade, Secwepemc author Arthur Manuel writes: &quot;Mainstream [[economists]] tend to value [[economic development|development]] strategies solely in terms of their [[wealth]] generation potential for [[industry]] and [[governments]]. So resources are viewed in strictly monetary terms. But indigenous peoples consider the value of land and resources in far broader, more integrated terms, including cultural, social, spiritual and environmental values, and their [[sustainability]]. Among indigenous peoples, decisions about caring for resources and the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] are usually made as part of a collective process, where the community takes into account a full spectrum of values and benefits other than short-term economic gains&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Manuel 2005: 177). From &quot;Indigenous Brief to WTO: How the Denial of Aboriginal Title Serves as an Illegal Export Subsidy.&quot; In PARADIGM WARS 177. (Jerry Mander and Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, eds., 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Around the world many indigenous groups have over centuries or millennia successfully sustained economies in one particular place and [[ecosystem]]. The co-adaptation of people with other elements of their [[ecological]] systems has meant that the integrity and functioning of these systems has been sustained even as the communities' culture developed and changed historically. These economic arrangements are viewed as one component of a cultural understandings that include [[sacred]] interactions with the world.&lt;ref&gt;For an attempt to correlate levels of knowledge of an ecosystem with the number of [[generations]] that a people have been living in a particular place, and a description of the means by which knowledge of [[sustainable]] [[economic]] practices becomes incorporated into the sacred practices and [[beliefs]] of a community, see F. Berkes, C. Folke, and M. Gadgil, Traditional Ecological Knowledge: [[Biodiversity]], Resilience, and Sustainability. In BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION 281-289. (C.A. Perry, ed.) (Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous economies can thus be seen to be sustainable to the extent to which the holders of culture interact in a culturally appropriate way with the world around them, including those elements of the world known to modern scientists as &quot;natural resources&quot;. In many areas indigenous people have sustained communities for centuries, and the ecological systems of which they are a component have maintained relative richness and resilience to natural perturbations such as drought or fires. The ecosystems that have been remained predominantly under control and care of indigenous peoples thus tend to be characterized by high [[biodiversity]], abundant renewable resources, and relatively unexploited nonrenewable resources. For many indigenous groups, the advent of globalization threatens the sustainability of their economies by making their land and knowledge valuable targets as commodities in a globalized economy.

== Environmental stresses and impacts on cultures ==
Cultures around the world are undergoing change due to environmental stresses, such as [[climate change]]. [[Globalization]] and increased [[consumerism]] are increasing environmental stress by contributing to [[deforestation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jensen &amp; George Draffan | first = Derrick | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Strangely Like War: The Global Assault on Forests | publisher = Chelsea Green Publishing | year = 2004 | location = White River Jct., Vermont | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 9781931498456}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to deforestation, other stresses such as introduction of foreign species,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Barringer | first = Felicity | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Where There's No Room for All Three of Them | publisher = NY Times | date = March 5, 2004 | location = | pages = sec.

Rev. | year = 1999 | location = | pages = 57 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indigenous resistance ==
In many cases, however, [[indigenous people]] have not passively acceded to the penetration of extractive capitalism into their communities. The following section thus not only reviews how [[globalization]] impacts indigenous people, but also describes how indigenous communities resist or negotiate to defend their territories and cultural integrity.

[[Economic policy]], when set on a global scale, can undermine the political gains that indigenous peoples may have made within the [[legal systems]] of nation states. Victor Menotti of the International Forum on Globalization has written of how [[World Trade Organization]](WTO) authority is diminishing the [[sovereignty]] of nation states over their land, [[water]], [[genetic material]], and public services.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Menotti. ''How the World Trade Organization (WTO) Diminishes Native Sovereignty''. In ''Paradigm Wars'', 46-57. (Jerry Mander and Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, eds., 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), for example, favors the privatization of systems (such as those for water distribution) that serve the general public but without an equitable provision of services that is often at odds with maximization of profits.&lt;ref&gt;Investment in [[infrastructure]] to provide [[water]] to a small village, for example, may not make business sense if the number of users is too small or too poor to provide a return on the initial [[construction]] costs. A national or local [[government agency]] may choose to pursue such a project either out of [[social responsibility]] or in response to [[politics|political]] pressure, but a private [[company]] is less likely to do so. Additionally, costs of basic services such as [[water]] often rise under [[privatization]] as companies seek to increase [[Profit (economics)|profits]], a change that can result in a loss of access for poor people. ''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Structural Adjustment Programs]] (SAPs) imposed as a condition of loans from global [[finance]] agencies such as the [[World Bank]] also often mandate [[privatization]]. The effects on indigenous peoples and other poor people can be devastating. World Bank-mandated SAP [[privatization]] of [[coal mining]] in the [[India]]n state of [[Orissa]] in the 1990s, for example, resulted in [[contamination]] of [[rivers]], increased rates of [[fluoride]] [[poison]]ing, [[infections]], and [[cancer]], displacement of towns, and power rates that increased by 500%.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Tauli-Corpuz. ''World Bank and IMF Impacts on Indigenous Economies''. In Paradigm Wars, 40. (Jerry Mander and Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, eds., 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank and IMF have also made [[water privatization]] a prior condition for granting loans and debt reductions.&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Juhasz. ''Global Water Wars''. In Paradigm Wars, 88-93. (Jerry Mander and Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, eds., 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Structural adjustment programs also weaken national-level environmental and labor laws that indigenous communities may have relied on in previous struggles to maintain control over territory and resources.&lt;ref&gt;Tauli-Corpuz, 42-43. For a specific overview of how a SAP resulted in an impoverishment of small-scale [[farmers]] as measured by household [[nutrition]] studies, see Wycliffe Chilowa, ''The Impact of Agricultural Liberalization on Food Security in Malawi''. FOOD POLICY. 23(6): 553-569. (1998). For an examination of how
SAPs lead to [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental]] degradation as rural people are forced into vulnerable situations, see David Kaimowitz, Graham Thiele, and Pablo Pacheco, ''The Effects of Structural Adjustment on Deforestation and Forest Degradation
in Lowland Bolivia''. WORLD DEVELOPMENT. 27(3): 505-520. (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other new international trade rules also negatively impact indigenous peoples. For example, Article I of GATT prohibits national governments from restricting [[imports|imported goods]] specifically from any single other [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] member nation. This article thus makes it impossible for national [[governments]] to restrict imports from other WTO countries with questionable [[human rights]], [[Labor relations|labor]], or [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental]] records and thus disallows a potential safeguard for the rights of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Menotti. ''How the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) Diminishes Native Sovereignty''. In Paradigm Wars 48. (Jerry Mander and Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, eds., 2005). Chillingly, Menotti notes that under current [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|GATT]] rules it would thus have been impossible to [[boycott]] [[South Africa]]n goods during [[apartheid]].&lt;/ref&gt; Article III of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|GATT]], together with its corollary Articles V and XI, requires governments to treat all imports &quot;no less favorably&quot; than locally produced goods and bans restrictions on imports. Victor Menotti writes of how this feature of [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|GATT]] &quot;prevents any government from favoring or protecting it own local [[industries]], or [[farmers]] or [[cultures]] that might otherwise by overwhelmed by globe-spanning [[corporations]] bringing vast amounts of cheap imports that make local or indigenous economies non-viable&quot;. Similar &quot;free trade&quot; policies under NAFTA have already been demonstrated to undercut the livelihoods of small-scale [[Mexican people|Mexican]] [[maize|corn]] farmers, many of whom are indigenous, who are unable
to compete with cheap, mass-produced [[grain]] from the [[United States|US]].&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalo Fanjul and Arabella Fraser. ''Dumping without Borders: How U.S. Agricultural Policies are Destroying the Livelihoods of [[Mexican people|Mexican]] [[Maize|Corn]] Farmers''. OXFAM BRIEFING PAPER NO. 50. (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technological impacts ==
[[Technological innovation]]s can enhance, displace or devalue human existence and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Marx | first = Leo | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Machine in the Garden: Technology and the Pastoral Idea in America | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1964 | location = Oxford, New York | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Advances in medical technology have contributed to [[demographic]] changes, including increased longevity and decreasing fertility. For example, although China has slowed its population increases through a [[One-child policy|one-child per family policy]], the [[median]] age of its people will soar in the next 35 years.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Kahn, ''The Most Populous Nation Faces a Population Crisis'', NY Times, May 30, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
In some Third World countries, kidneys, eyes and skin are sold in a flourishing market for body parts.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Kimbrell, The Patenting of Life and the Global Market on Body Parts, in ''The Case Against the Global Economy and for a Turn Toward the Local'' 141-144 (J. Mander &amp; E. Goldsmith), eds. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also rising concern amongst many{{quantify|date=November 2010}} [[indigenous people]] groups over the interrelated issues of genetic patenting and [[biopiracy]]. For example, a [[Guaymi]] woman was diagnosed with [[leukemia]] in 1991. Whilst in hospital in the city of [[Panama]] she had blood samples taken and without her knowledge or free, prior, and informed consent. The cell-line enclosed in these samples was stored, &quot;immortalized&quot;, [[patented]], and put up for sale at a price of $136 US dollars. The scientists involved in this process claimed to have &quot;invented&quot; this woman's cell-line. Their rationale for taking the samples and processing them for patenting was that these samples held &quot;commercial promise&quot; in the scientific world for the discovery of potential medical breakthroughs and that the government{{which?|date=November 2010}} encourages the patenting of anything which may have a link to such a discovery. The main contention in the debate apart from [[ethical]] dilemmas over genetic research is the fact that the woman from whom the samples were taken was never consulted about the process, so in effect, the whole process was done without her knowing it was going on or understanding what was happening to her.&lt;ref&gt;Whitt, L. Science, Colonialism, and Indigenous Peoples: The Cultural Politics of Law and Knowledge, 2009, Cambridge University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  This presents an additional dilemma alongside the issue of [[genetic manipulation]]: [[freedom of information]].  There is also the implication of &quot;why her&quot;, &quot;why an indigenous Guaymi woman and not a Euro-American&quot;. This type of technological case-in-point presents as a more recent dilemma for indigenous groups because commonly, such failure to properly inform insofar as the impact of either scientific research endeavours or corporate-style [[Business development|development]] schemes are concerned has historically tended to coincide with policies and paradigms of practice which have their basis in [[racial discrimination]].{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

On the more positive side, certain technological innovations such as computers, the Internet, and miscellaneous sound and visual [[recording medium|recording media]] have been welcomed and embraced by indigenous peoples as a means of communicating to wider society their concerns about the dilemmas not only faced by them but by the whole world in view of the extent of [[socioeconomic]], cultural and political transformations that have continued to evolve and impact global diversity in far-reaching and often unpredictable ways.

'''Popular history''' is a broad and somewhat ill-defined [[genre]] of [[historiography]] that takes a popular approach, aims at a wide readership, and usually emphasizes [[narrative]], [[Personality type|personality]] and vivid detail over scholarly analysis. The term is used in contradistinction to professional academic or scholarly history writing which is usually more specialized and technical and, thus, less accessible to the general reader.Some '''popular historians''' are without academic affiliation while others are academics, or former academics, that have (according to one writer) ?become somehow abstracted from the academic arena, becoming cultural commentators?&lt;ref&gt; De Groot, Jerome (2009), [http://books.google.com/books?id=hexpdOj8t80C&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=%22popular+historian%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yvNFz2kvUh&amp;sig=io51iX8gENuqr0egzP2J9JpLwGM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZBSxSpqCKYmf8Qbh7MHCDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22popular%20historian%22&amp;f=false ''Consuming History: Historians and Heritage in Contemporary Popular Culture''], [[Routledge]], pg 15.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Popular historians may become nationally renowned or best-selling authors and may or may not serve the interests of particular political viewpoints in their roles as ?public historians?. Many authors of ?official histories? and ?authorized biographies? would qualify as popular historians serving the interests of particular institutions or public figures.

Recent examples of American popular historians with academic affiliations include [[Stephen Ambrose]], [[Doris Kearns Goodwin]] and [[Pauline Maier]].{{fact|date=January 2012}} Non-academics include [[Bruce Catton]], [[Shelby Foote]] and [[Barbara Tuchman]].{{fact|date=January 2012}}

Recent examples of British popular historians include [[Niall Ferguson]], [[Christopher Hibbert]] and [[Simon Schama]] and ? from a previous generation ? [[E.P. Thompson]], [[A.J.P. Taylor]], and [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]]. {{fact|date=January 2012}}

History can be described as all of the following:

* [[Academic discipline]] &amp;ndash; body of knowledge given to - or received by - a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialise in.
** one of the [[humanities]] &amp;ndash; academic discipline that study the human condition, using methods that are primarily analytical, critical, or speculative, as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of the natural sciences.
* [[Fields of science|Field of science]]  &amp;ndash; widely-recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature.  Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published.  There are many sociology-related scientific journals.
** [[Social science]]  &amp;ndash; field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society.

'''History''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|''???????''}} - ''historia'', meaning &quot;inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation&quot;&lt;ref name=JosephJanda/&gt;) is the discovery, collection, organization, and presentation of information about past events. History can also mean the period of time after writing was invented. Scholars who write about history are called [[historian]]s. It is a field of research which uses a [[narrative]] to examine and analyse the sequence of events, and it sometimes attempts to investigate objectively the patterns of cause and effect that determine events.&lt;ref name=&quot;evans1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Focus/Whatishistory/evans10.html|title= The Two Faces of E.H.

Amongst scholars, the fifth-century BC Greek historian [[Herodotus]] is considered to be the &quot;father of history&quot;, and, along with his contemporary [[Thucydides]], forms the foundations for the modern study of history. Their influence, along with other historical traditions in other parts of their world, have spawned many different interpretations of the nature of history which has evolved over the centuries and are continuing to change. The modern study of history has many different fields including those that focus on certain regions and those which focus on certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation. Often history is taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a major discipline in University studies.

==Etymology==
[[File:History-Dielman-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|''History'' by [[Frederick Dielman]] (1896)]]
A  derivation from ''*weid-'' &quot;know&quot; or &quot;see&quot; is attested as &quot;the reconstructed etymon ''wid-tor'' [&quot;one who knows&quot;] (compare to English ''wit'') a suffixed zero-grade  form of the [[proto-Indo-European root|PIE]] root ''*weid-''-'see' and so is related to Greek ''eid&amp;eacute;nai'', to know &quot;...&lt;ref name=JosephJanda&gt;{{Cite book| last =Joseph | first =Brian (Ed.)| last2 =Janda | first2 =Richard (Ed.)| publication-date =30 December 2004| title =The Handbook of Historical Linguistics| publisher =Blackwell Publishing| page =163| isbn =978-1405127479| year =2008| postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;etym&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=history |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient Greek]] [[polytonic|???????]]&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|i(stori/a|???????}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''h?st?r'') means &quot;inquiry&quot;,&quot;knowledge from inquiry&quot;, or  &quot;judge&quot;. It was in that sense that [[Aristotle]] used the word in his {{polytonic|[[History of Animals|???? ?? ??? ????????]]}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferrater-Mora&quot;&gt;Ferrater-Mora, Jos?. ''Diccionario de Filosofia''. Barcelona: Editorial Ariel, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Per? T? Z?a ?istor?ai'' &quot;Inquiries about Animals&quot;). The ancestor word {{polytonic|?????}} is attested early on in [[Homeric Hymns]], [[Heraclitus]], the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[ephebos|ephebe]]s' oath, and in [[Boeotia|Boiotic]] inscriptions (in a legal sense, either &quot;judge&quot; or &quot;witness&quot;, or similar).

The word entered the [[English language]] in 1390 with the meaning of &quot;relation of incidents, story&quot;. In [[Middle English]], the meaning was &quot;story&quot; in general. The restriction to the meaning &quot;record of past events&quot; arises in the late 15th century. It was still in the Greek sense that [[Francis Bacon]] used the term in the late 16th century, when he wrote about &quot;[[Natural history|Natural History]]&quot;. For him, ''historia'' was &quot;the knowledge of objects determined by space and time&quot;, that sort of knowledge provided by [[memory]] (while [[science]] was provided by [[reason]], and [[poetry]] was provided by [[fantasy]]).

In an expression of the linguistic [[Synthetic language|synthetic vs. analytic/isolating dichotomy]], English like Chinese (? vs. ?) now designates separate words for human history and [[storytelling]] in general. In modern German, French, and most Germanic and Romance languages, which are solidly synthetic and highly inflected, the same word is still used to mean both &quot;history&quot; and &quot;story&quot;.

The adjective ''historical'' is attested from 1661, and ''historic'' from 1669.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitney&quot;&gt;Whitney, W. D. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language]''. New York: The Century Co, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Historian'' in the sense of a &quot;researcher of history&quot; is attested from 1531. In all [[European languages]], the substantive &quot;history&quot; is still used to mean both &quot;what happened with men&quot;, and &quot;the scholarly study of the happened&quot;, the latter sense sometimes distinguished with a capital letter, &quot;History&quot;, or the word ''[[historiography]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferrater-Mora&quot; /&gt;

==Description==
[[File:The Historians' History of the World - Title Page.jpg|thumb|The title page to ''[[The Historians' History of the World]]'']]
Historians write in the context of their own time, and with due regard to the current dominant ideas of how to interpret the past, and sometimes write to provide lessons for their own society. In the words of [[Benedetto Croce]], &quot;All history is contemporary history&quot;. History is facilitated by the formation of a 'true discourse of past' through the production of narrative and analysis of past events relating to the human race.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitney&quot;&gt;Whitney, W. D. (1889). [http://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language]. New York: The Century Co. Page [http://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA2842,M1 2842].&lt;/ref&gt; The modern discipline of history is dedicated to the institutional production of this discourse.

All events that are remembered and preserved in some authentic form constitute the historical record.&lt;ref name=&quot;wordnet&quot;&gt;[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn WordNet Search ? 3.0], &quot;History&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The task of historical discourse is to identify the sources which can most usefully contribute to the production of accurate accounts of past. Therefore, the constitution of the historian's archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive by invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents (by falsifying their claims to represent the 'true past').

The study of history has sometimes been classified as part of the [[humanities]] and at other times as part of the [[social sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott Gordon and James Gordon Irving, ''The History and Philosophy of Social Science''. Routledge 1991. Page 1. ISBN 0415056829&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be seen as a bridge between those two broad areas, incorporating methodologies from both. Some individual historians strongly support one or the other classification.&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, H. (1986). Dictionary of concepts in history. Reference sources for the social sciences and humanities, no. 3. Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press. Page 416.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, French [[historian]] [[Fernand Braudel]] revolutionized the study of history, by using such outside disciplines as [[economics]], [[anthropology]], and [[geography]] in the study of global history.

Traditionally, historians have recorded events of the past, either in writing or by passing on an [[oral tradition]], and have attempted to answer historical questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts. For the beginning, historians have also used such sources as monuments, inscriptions, and pictures. In general, the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories: what is written, what is said, and what is physically preserved, and historians often consult all three.&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Lemon (1995).The Discipline of History and the History of Thought. Routledge. Page 201. ISBN 0415123461&lt;/ref&gt; But writing is the marker that separates history from what comes before.

[[Archaeology]] is a discipline that is especially helpful in dealing with buried sites and objects, which, once unearthed, contribute to the study of history. But archaeology rarely stands alone. It uses narrative sources to complement its discoveries. However, archaeology is constituted by a range of methodologies and approaches which are independent from history; that is to say, archaeology does not &quot;fill the gaps&quot; within textual sources. Indeed, Historical Archaeology is a specific branch of archaeology, often contrasting its conclusions against those of contemporary textual sources. For example, Mark Leone, the excavator and interpreter of historical [[Annapolis, Maryland]], USA has sought to understand the contradiction between textual documents and the material record, demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth apparent via the study of the total historical environment, despite the ideology of &quot;liberty&quot; inherent in written documents at this time.

There are varieties of ways in which history can be organized, including chronologically, [[culture|culturally]], territorially, and thematically. These divisions are not mutually exclusive, and significant overlaps are often present, as in &quot;The International Women's Movement in an Age of Transition, 1830?1975.&quot; It is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general, although the modern trend has been toward specialization. The area called [[Big History]] resists this specialization, and searches for universal patterns or trends. History has often been studied with some practical or [[theory|theoretical]] aim, but also may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity.&lt;ref name=&quot;graham-ch1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Shape of the Past |author=Graham, Gordon |publisher=[[Oxford University]] |year=1997 |chapter=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and prehistory==
{{Human history and prehistory|250}}
{{See|Protohistory}}

The [[history of the world]] is the memory of the past [[experience]] of ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' around the world, as that experience has been preserved, largely in written records. By &quot;prehistory&quot;, historians mean the recovery of knowledge of the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood. [[Human history]] is marked both by a gradual [[List of discoveries|accretion of discoveries]] and [[Timeline of historic inventions|inventions]], as well as by [[quantum leap]]s?[[paradigm shift]]s, [[revolution]]s?that comprise epochs in the material and spiritual evolution of humankind. By studying painting, drawings, carvings, and other artifacts, some information can be recovered even in the absence of a written record. Since the 20th century, the study of prehistory is considered essential to avoid history's implicit exclusion of certain civilizations, such as those of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[pre-Columbian]] America. Historians in the West have been criticized for focusing disproportionately on the [[Western world]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] (2007) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=jo1UVi48KywC&amp;pg=RA2-PA1930&amp;dq=Jack+Goody+2007&amp;sig=g0N7ZF9nz_Uy8nrQTiGdsc0N3sI#PPA12,M1 The Theft of History]'' (from [[Google Books]])&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, British historian [[E. H. Carr]] wrote:
{{quote|The line of demarcation between prehistoric and historical times is crossed when people cease to live only in the present, and become consciously interested both in their past and in their future. History begins with the handing down of tradition; and tradition means the carrying of the habits and lessons of the past into the future. Records of the past begin to be kept for the benefit of future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Edward H. (1961). ''What is History?'', p.108, ISBN 0140206523&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This definition includes within the scope of history the strong interests of peoples, such as [[Australian Aboriginals]] and New Zealand [[M?ori people|M?ori]] in the past, and the oral records maintained and transmitted to succeeding generations, even before their contact with European civilization.

==Historiography==
{{Main|Historiography}}
Historiography has a number of related meanings. Firstly, it can refer to how history has been produced: the story of the development of [[Historical method|methodology]] and practices (for example, the move from short-term biographical narrative towards long-term thematic analysis). Secondly, it can refer to what has been produced: a specific body of historical writing (for example, &quot;medieval historiography during the 1960s&quot; means &quot;Works of medieval history written during the 1960s&quot;). Thirdly, it may refer to why history is produced: the [[Philosophy of history]]. As a [[meta-level]] analysis of descriptions of the past, this third conception can relate to the first two in that the analysis usually focuses on the narratives, [[Language interpretation|interpretation]]s, [[worldview]], use of [[evidence]], or method of presentation of other [[historian]]s. Professional historians also debate the question of whether history can be taught as a single coherent narrative or a series of competing narratives.

* What is the proper unit for the study of the human past?the individual? The polis? The civilization? The culture? Or the nation state?
* Are there broad patterns and progress? Are there cycles? Is human history random and devoid of any meaning?
|}

{{Main|Philosophy of history}}
Philosophy of history is a branch of philosophy concerning the eventual significance, if any, of human history. Furthermore, it speculates as to a possible teleological end to its development?that is, it asks if there is a design, purpose, directive principle, or finality in the processes of human history. Philosophy of history should not be confused with historiography, which is the study of history as an academic discipline, and thus concerns its methods and practices, and its development as a discipline over time. Nor should philosophy of history be confused with the [[history of philosophy]], which is the study of the development of philosophical ideas through time.

&lt;div style=&quot;background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;&quot;&gt; Historical method basics &lt;/div&gt;

The following questions are used by historians in modern work.
# ''When was'' the source, written or unwritten, produced ([[Calendar date|date]])?
# Where was it produced ([[Internationalization and localization|localization]])?
# By whom was it produced ([[authorship]])?
# From what pre-existing material was it produced ([[wikt:analysis|analysis]])?
# In what original form was it produced ([[integrity]])?
# What is the evidential value of its contents ([[credibility]])?
The first four are known as [[higher criticism]]; the fifth, [[lower criticism]]; and, together, external criticism. ''The sixth and final inquiry'' about a source is called internal criticism.

The historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which [[historian]]s use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to [[historiography|write history]].

[[Herodotus]] of [[Halicarnassus]] (484 BC ? ca.425 BC)&lt;ref name=&quot;lamberg-karlovsky-p5&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C. C. and Jeremy A. Sabloff |publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing |year=1979 |page=5|isbn=0881338346}}&lt;/ref&gt; has generally been acclaimed as the &quot;father of history&quot;. However, his contemporary [[Thucydides]] (ca. 460 BC ? ca. 400 BC) is credited with having first approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work the [[History of the Peloponnesian War]]. Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at cause and effect, rather than as the result of divine intervention.&lt;ref name=&quot;lamberg-karlovsky-p5&quot;/&gt; In his historical method, Thucydides emphasized chronology, a neutral point of view, and that the human world was the result of the actions of human beings. Greek historians also viewed history as [[Historic recurrence|cyclical]], with events regularly recurring.&lt;ref name=&quot;lamberg-karlovsky-p6&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C. C. and Jeremy A. Sabloff |publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing |year=1979 |page=6|isbn=0881338346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were historical traditions and sophisticated use of historical method in ancient and medieval [[China]]. The groundwork for professional historiography in [[East Asia]] was established by the [[Han Dynasty]] court historian known as [[Sima Qian]] (145?90 BC), author of the ''[[Shiji]]'' ([[Records of the Grand Historian]]). For the quality of his timeless written work, Sima Qian is posthumously known as the Father of [[Chinese Historiography]]. Chinese historians of subsequent dynastic periods in China used his ''Shiji'' as the official format for [[Twenty-Four Histories|historical texts]], as well as for biographical literature.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] was influential in [[Western Christianity|Christian]] and [[Western thought]] at the beginning of the medieval period. Through the Medieval and [[Renaissance]] periods, history was often studied through a [[sacred history|sacred]] or religious perspective. Around 1800, German philosopher and historian [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] brought [[philosophy]] and a more [[secular]] approach in historical study.&lt;ref name=&quot;graham-ch1&quot;/&gt;

In the preface to his book, the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377), the [[Historiography of early Islam|Arab historian]] and [[Sociology in medieval Islam|early sociologist]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. The originality of Ibn Khaldun was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation of relevant historical material, to distinguish the principles according to which it might be possible to attempt the evaluation, and lastly, to feel the need for experience, in addition to rational principles, in order to assess a culture of the past. Ibn Khaldun often criticized &quot;idle [[superstition]] and uncritical acceptance of historical data.&quot; As a result, he introduced a [[scientific method]] to the study of history, and he often referred to it as his &quot;new science&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], Franz Rosenthal, N. J. Dawood (1967), ''The Muqaddimah: An Introduction to History'', p. x, [[Princeton University Press]], ISBN 0691017549.&lt;/ref&gt; His historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of [[State (polity)|state]], [[communication]], [[propaganda]] and [[systematic bias]] in history,&lt;ref name=Mowlana&gt;H.

In the West historians developed modern methods of historiography in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and Germany. The 19th-century historian with greatest influence on methods was [[Leopold von Ranke]] in Germany.

In the 20th century, academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or individuals, to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a [[social science]] rather than as an [[art]], which traditionally had been the case. Some of the leading advocates of history as a social science were a diverse collection of scholars which included [[Fernand Braudel]], [[E. H. Carr]], [[Fritz Fischer]], [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], [[Bruce Trigger]], [[Marc Bloch]], [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], [[Peter Gay]], [[Robert Fogel]], [[Lucien Febvre]] and [[Lawrence Stone]]. Many of the advocates of history as a social science were or are noted for their multi-disciplinary approach. Braudel combined history with geography, Bracher history with political science, Fogel history with economics, Gay history with psychology, Trigger history with archaeology while Wehler, Bloch, Fischer, Stone, Febvre and Le Roy Ladurie have in varying and differing ways amalgamated history with sociology, geography, anthropology, and economics. More recently, the field of [[digital history]] has begun to address ways of using computer technology to pose new questions to historical data and generate digital scholarship.

In opposition to the claims of history as a social science, historians such as [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], [[John Lukacs]], [[Donald Creighton]], [[Gertrude Himmelfarb]] and [[Gerhard Ritter]] argued that the key to the historians' work was the power of the [[imagination]], and hence contended that history should be understood as an art. French historians associated with the [[Annales School]] introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of [[cultural history]] (cf. ''[[histoire des mentalit?s]]''). Intellectual historians such as [[Herbert Butterfield]], [[Ernst Nolte]] and [[George Mosse]] have argued for the significance of ideas in history. American historians, motivated by the civil rights era, focused on formerly overlooked ethnic, racial, and socio-economic groups. Another genre of [[social history]] to emerge in the post-WWII era was ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]'' (History of Everyday Life). Scholars such as [[Martin Broszat]], [[Ian Kershaw]] and [[Detlev Peukert]] sought to examine what everyday life was like for ordinary people in 20th-century Germany, especially in the [[Nazi]] period.

[[Marxist historiography|Marxist historians]] such as [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Rodney Hilton]], [[Georges Lefebvre]], [[Eugene D. Genovese]], [[Isaac Deutscher]], [[C. L. R. James]], [[Timothy Mason]], [[Herbert Aptheker]], [[Arno J. Mayer]] and [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] have sought to validate [[Karl Marx]]'s theories by analyzing history from a Marxist perspective. In response to the Marxist interpretation of history, historians such as [[Fran?ois Furet]], [[Richard Pipes]], [[J. C. D. Clark]], [[Roland Mousnier]], [[Henry Ashby Turner]] and [[Robert Conquest]] have offered anti-Marxist interpretations of history. [[Feminism|Feminist]] historians such as [[Joan Wallach Scott]], [[Claudia Koonz]], [[Natalie Zemon Davis]], [[Sheila Rowbotham]], [[Gisela Bock]], [[Gerda Lerner]], [[Elizabeth Fox-Genovese]], and [[Lynn Hunt]] have argued for the importance of studying the experience of women in the past. In recent years, [[postmodernism|postmodernists]] have challenged the validity and need for the study of history on the basis that all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources. In his 1997 book ''In Defence of History'', [[Richard J. Evans]], a professor of modern history at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], defended the worth of history. Another defence of history from post-modernist criticism was the Australian historian [[Keith Windschuttle]]'s 1994 book, ''The Killing of History''.

==Historians==
{{Main|List of historians}}

Professional and amateur historians discover, collect, organize, and present information about past events. In [[list of historians|lists of historians]], historians can be grouped by order of the historical period in which they were writing, which is not necessarily the same as the period in which they specialized. Chroniclers and annalists, though they are not historians in the true sense, are also frequently included.

===Periods===
{{Main|Periodization}}
Historical study often focuses on events and developments that occur in particular blocks of time. Historians give these [[Periodization|periods of time]] names in order to allow &quot;organising ideas and classificatory generalisations&quot; to be used by historians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marwick-p169&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Nature of History |author=Marwick, Arthur|publisher=The Macmillian Press LTD |year=1970 |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names given to a period can vary with geographical location, as can the dates of the start and end of a particular period. [[Centuries]] and [[decade]]s are commonly used periods and the time they represent depends on the [[Calendar era|dating system]] used. Most periods are constructed retrospectively and so reflect value judgments made about the past. The way periods are constructed and the names given to them can affect the way they are viewed and studied.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tosh-p168-169&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pursuit of History|author=Tosh, John|publisher=Pearson Education Limited|year=2006 |pages=168?169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geographical locations===
Particular [[geographical]] locations can form the basis of historical study, for example, [[continent]]s, [[countries]] and [[cities]]. Understanding why historic events took place is important. To do this, historians often turn to [[geography]]. Weather patterns, the water supply, and the landscape of a place all affect the lives of the people who live there. For example, to explain why the ancient Egyptians developed a successful civilization, studying the [[geography of Egypt]] is essential. Egyptian civilization was built on the banks of the Nile River, which flooded each year, depositing soil on its banks. The rich soil could help farmers grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities. That meant everyone did not have to farm, so some people could perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization.

====World====
{{Main|History of the world}}
World history is the study of major civilizations over the last 3000 years or so. It has led to highly controversial interpretations by [[Oswald Spengler]] and [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], among others. World history is especially important as a teaching field. It has increasingly entered the university curriculum in the U.S., in many cases replacing courses in Western Civilization, that had a focus on Europe and the U.S. World history adds extensive new material on Asia, Africa and Latin America.

====Regions====
* [[History of Africa]] begins with the first emergence of modern human beings on the continent, continuing into its modern present as a patchwork of diverse and politically developing nation states.
* [[History of the Americas]] is the collective history of North and South America, including Central America and the Caribbean.
** [[History of North America]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation on the continent in the Earth's northern and western hemisphere.
** [[History of Central America]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation on the continent in the Earth's western hemisphere.
** [[History of the Caribbean]] begins with the oldest evidence where 7,000-year-old remains have been found.
** [[History of South America]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation on the continent in the Earth's southern and western hemisphere.
* [[History of Antarctica]] emerges from early Western theories of a vast continent, known as Terra Australis, believed to exist in the far south of the globe.
* [[History of Australia]] start with the documentation of the Makassar trading with Indigenous Australians on Australia's north coast.
* [[History of New Zealand]] dates back at least 700 years to when it was discovered and settled by Polynesians, who developed a distinct M?ori culture centred on kinship links and land.
* [[History of the Pacific Islands]] covers the history of the islands in the Pacific Ocean.
* [[History of Eurasia]] is the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions: the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Europe, linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian steppe of Central Asia and Eastern Europe.
** [[History of Europe]] describes the passage of time from humans inhabiting the European continent to the present day.
** [[History of Asia]] can be seen as the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions, East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian steppe.
*** [[History of East Asia]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation in East Asia.
*** [[History of the Middle East]] begins with the earliest civilizations in the region now known as the Middle East that were established around 3000 BC, in Mesopotamia (Iraq).
*** [[History of South Asia]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation in the Sub-Himalayan region.
*** [[History of Southeast Asia]] has been characterized as interaction between regional players and foreign powers.

===Military history===
{{Main|Military history}}

[[Military history]] concerns warfare, strategies, battles, weapons, and the psychology of combat.  The &quot;new military history&quot; since the 1970s has been concerned with soldiers more than generals, with psychology more than tactics, and with the broader impact of warfare on society and culture.&lt;ref name=Pavkovic&gt;{{Cite book | last =Pavkovic

===History of religion===
The history of religion has been a main theme for both secular and religious historians for centuries, and continues to be taught in seminaries and academe. Leading journals include Church History,  [[Catholic Historical Review]], and ''History of Religions''. Topics range widely from political and cultural and artistic dimensions, to theology and liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Cochrane, &quot;What Is Catholic Historiography?&quot; ''Catholic Historical Review'' Vol. 61, No. 2 (Apr., 1975), pp. 169-190 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/25019673 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Every major country is covered,&lt;ref&gt;For example see Sofia Boesch Gajano and Tommaso Cali?, &quot;Italian religious historiography in the 1990s,&quot; ''Journal of Modern Italian Studies,'' Fall 1998, Vol. 3 Issue 3, pp 293-306&lt;/ref&gt; and most smaller ones as well.

===Social history===
{{Main|Social history}}
''Social history'', sometimes called the ''new social history,'' is the field that includes history of ordinary people and their strategies and institutions for coping with life.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stearns, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Social History'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; In its &quot;golden age&quot; it was a major growth field in the 1960s and 1970s among scholars, and still is well represented in history departments. In two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history rose from 31% to 41%, while the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%.  Based on full-time professors in U.S. history departments. Stephen H. Haber, David M. Kennedy, and Stephen D. Krasner, &quot;Brothers under the Skin: Diplomatic History and International Relations,&quot; ''International Security,'' Vol. 22, No. 1 (Summer, 1997), pp. 34-43 at p. 4 2; [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2539326 online at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the history departments of British universities in 2007, of the 5723 faculty members, 1644 (29%)  identified themselves with '''social history''' while [[political history]] came next with 1425 (25%).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Resources/Teachers/a27.html &quot;Teachers of History in the Universities of the UK 2007 - listed by research interest&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
The &quot;old&quot; social history before the 1960s was a hodgepodge of topics without a central theme, and it often included political movements, like Populism, that were &quot;social&quot; in the sense of being outside the elite system. Social history was contrasted with [[political history]], [[intellectual history]] and the history of [[Great man theory|great men]]. English historian [[G. M. Trevelyan]] saw it as the bridging point between economic and political history, reflecting that, &quot;Without social history, economic history is barren and political history unintelligible.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=English Social History: A Survey of Six Centuries from Chaucer to Queen Victoria|author=[[G. M. Trevelyan]]|publisher=Book Club Associates|year=1973|chapter=Introduction|page=i|isbn=058248488X}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the field has often been viewed negatively as history with the politics left out, it has also been defended as &quot;history with the people put back in.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The People's State: East German Society from Hitler to Honecker|author=Mary Fulbrook|location=London|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year=2005|chapter=Introduction: The people's paradox|page=17|isbn=9780300144246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Cultural history}}
Cultural history replaced [[social history]] as the dominant form in the 1980s and 1990s. It typically combines the approaches of anthropology and history to look at language, popular cultural traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. It examines the records and narrative descriptions of past knowledge, customs, and arts of a group of people. How peoples constructed their memory of the past is a major topic.

===Diplomatic history===
{{Main|Diplomatic history}}
[[Diplomatic history]], sometimes referred to as &quot;''Rankian History''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Burke, P. (1998). New perspectives on historical writing. University Park, Pa: [[Pennsylvania State University Press]]. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; in honor of [[Leopold von Ranke]], focuses on [[politics]], politicians and other high rulers and views them as being the driving force of continuity and change in history. This type of ''political history'' is the study of the conduct of [[International relations#History|international relations]] between states or across state boundaries over time. This is the most common form of history and is often the classical and popular belief of what history should be.

===Economic history===
{{main|Economic history}}
Although economic history has been well established since the late 19th century, in recent years academic studies have shifted more and more toward economics departments and away from traditional history departments.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Whaples, &quot;Is Economic History a Neglected Field of Study?,&quot; Historically Speaking (April 2010) v. 11#2 pp 17-20, with responses pp 20-27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental history===
{{main|Environmental history}}
Environmental history is a new field that emerged in the 1980s to look at the history of the environment, especially in the long run, and the impact of human activities upon it.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Hughes, ''What is Environmental History'' (2006) [http://www.amazon.com/What-Environmental-History/dp/0745631886/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

===World history===
{{main|World History}}
World history is primarily a teaching field, rather than a research field.  It gained popularity in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Ainslie T. Embree and Carol Gluck, eds., ''Asia in Western and World History: A Guide for Teaching''  (M.E. Sharpe, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Japan&lt;ref&gt;Shigeru Akita, &quot;World History and the Emergence of Global History in Japan,&quot;''Chinese Studies in History,'' Spring 2010, Vol. 43 Issue 3, pp 84-96&lt;/ref&gt; and other countries after the 1980s with the realization that students need a broader exposure to the world as globalization proceeds.

The World History Association publishes the ''Journal of World History'' every quarter since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.historycooperative.org/jwhindex.html JWH Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The H-World discussion list&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.h-net.org/~world/ H-World]&lt;/ref&gt; serves as a network of communication among practitioners of world history, with discussions among scholars, announcements, syllabi, bibliographies and book reviews.

===People's history===
{{Main|People's history}}
A [[people's history]] is a type of historical work which attempts to account for historical events from the [[Populism|perspective of common people]]. A people's history is the history of the world that is the story of mass movements and of the outsiders. Individuals or groups not included in the past in other type of writing about history are the primary focus, which includes the [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]], the [[oppression|oppressed]], the [[poverty|poor]], the [[Nonconformism|nonconformists]], and the otherwise  forgotten people. This history also usually focuses on events occurring in the fullness of time, or when an overwhelming wave of smaller events cause certain developments to occur.

===Historiometry===
{{Main|Historiometry }}
[[Historiometry]] is a historical study of human progress or individual personal characteristics, by using statistics to analyze references to eminent persons, their statements, behavior and discoveries in relatively neutral texts.

===Gender history===
{{Main|Gender history}}
[[Gender history]] is a sub-field of History and [[Gender studies]], which looks at the past from the perspective of [[gender]]. It is in many ways, an outgrowth of [[women's history]]. Despite its relatively short life, Gender History (and its forerunner Women's History) has had a rather significant effect on the general study of history. Since the 1960s, when the initially small field first achieved a measure of acceptance, it has gone through a number of different phases, each with its own challenges and outcomes. Although some of the changes to the study of history have been quite obvious, such as increased numbers of books on famous women or simply the admission of greater numbers of women into the historical profession, other influences are more subtle.

===Public history===
{{Main|Public history}}
[[Public history]] is a term that describes the broad range of activities undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of history who are generally working outside of specialized academic settings. Public history practice has quite deep roots in the areas of historic preservation, archival science, oral history, museum curatorship, and other related fields. The term itself began to be used in the U.S. and Canada in the late 1970s, and the field has become increasingly professionalized since that time. Some of the most common settings for public history are museums, historic homes and historic sites, parks, battlefields, archives, film and television companies, and all levels of government.

==Pseudohistory==
{{Main|Pseudohistory}}

''[[Pseudohistory]]'' is a term applied to texts which purport to be historical in nature but which depart from standard [[Historical method|historiographical conventions]] in a way which undermines their conclusions.
Closely related to deceptive [[historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionsm]], works which draw controversial conclusions from new, speculative, or disputed historical evidence, particularly in the fields of national, political, military, and religious affairs, are often rejected as pseudohistory.

==Teaching history ==
From the origins of national school systems in the 19th century, the teaching of history to promote national sentiment has been a high priority.  In the United States after World War I, a strong movement emerged at the university level to teach courses in Western Civilization, so as to give students a common heritage with Europe. In the U.S. after 1980 attention increasingly moved toward teaching [[world history]] or requiring students to take courses in non-western cultures, to prepare students for life in a globalized economy.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Swansinger, &quot;Preparing Student Teachers for a World History Curriculum in New York,&quot; ''History Teacher,'' (Nov 2009), 43#1 pp 87-96&lt;/ref&gt;

At the university level, historians debate the question of whether history belongs more to social science or to the humanities. Many view the field from both perspectives.

The teaching of history in French schools was influenced by the [[Nouvelle histoire]] as disseminated after the 1960s by ''Cahiers p?dagogiques and Enseignement'' and other journals for teachers. Also influential was the Institut national de recherche et de documentation p?dagogique, (INRDP).  Joseph Leif, the Inspector-general of teacher training, said pupils children should learn about historians? approaches as well as facts and dates. Louis Fran?ois, Dean of the History/Geography group in the Inspectorate of National Education advised that teachers should provide historic documents and promote &quot;active methods&quot; which would give pupils &quot;the immense happiness of discovery.&quot; Proponents said it was a reaction against the memorization of names and dates that characterized teaching and left the students bored. Traditionalists protested loudly it was a postmodern innovation that threatened to leave the youth ignorant of French patriotism and national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Abby Waldman, &quot; The Politics of History Teaching in England and France during the 1980s,&quot; ''History Workshop Journal''  Issue 68, Autumn 2009 pp. 199-221  [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_workshop_journal/v068/68.waldman.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political correctness===
{{details|political historical revisionism}}
In most countries history textbook are tools to foster nationalism and patriotism, and give students the official line about national enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Nicholls, ed. ''School History Textbooks across Cultures: International Debates and Perspectives'' (2006) &lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries history textbooks are sponsored by the national government and are written to put the national heritage in the most favorable light. For example, in Japan, mention of the [[Nanking Massacre]] has been removed from textbooks and the entire World War II is given cursory treatment. Other countries have complained.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Schneider, &quot;The Japanese History Textbook Controversy in East Asian Perspective,&quot; ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,'' May 2008, Vol. 617, pp 107-122&lt;/ref&gt; It was standard policy in communist countries to present only a rigid Marxist historiography.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Problems of Teaching Contemporary Russian History,&quot; ''Russian Studies in History,'' Winter 2004, Vol. 43 Issue 3, pp 61-62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-2346.2008.00708.x?cookieSet=1 |title=Blackwell-Synergy.com |publisher=Blackwell-Synergy.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States the history of the [[American Civil War]] was phrased to avoid giving offense to white Southerners and blacks.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Loewen, ''Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong'', (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic historians have often fought against the politicization of the textbooks, sometimes with success.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Teaching History in Schools: the Politics of Textbooks in India,&quot; ''History Workshop Journal,'' April 2009, Issue 67, pp 99-110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tatyana Volodina, &quot;Teaching History in Russia After the Collapse of the USSR,&quot; ''History Teacher,'' Feb 2005, Vol. 38 Issue 2, pp 179-188&lt;/ref&gt;

In 21st-century Germany, the history curriculum is controlled by the 16 states, and is characterized not by superpatriotism but rather by an &quot;almost pacifistic and deliberately unpatriotic undertone&quot; and reflects &quot;principles formulated by international organizations such as UNESCO or the Council of Europe, thus oriented towards human rights, democracy and peace.&quot;  The result is that &quot;German textbooks usually downplay national pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship centred on democracy, progress, human rights, peace, tolerance and Europeanness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Simone L?ssig and Karl Heinrich Pohl, &quot;History Textbooks and Historical Scholarship in Germany,&quot; ''History Workshop Journal'' Issue 67, Spring 2009 pp 128-9 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_workshop_journal/v067/67.lassig.html online at project MUSE]&lt;/ref&gt;

==By ideological classification (historiography)==
Although there is arguably some intrinsic [[bias]] in history studies (with [[nationalism|national]] bias perhaps being the most significant), history can also be studied from [[ideology|ideological]] perspectives, which practitioners feel are often ignored, such as:
*[[Marxist historiography]]
*[[Feminist history]] (also called ''herstory'').

A form of historical speculation known commonly as [[counterfactual history]] has also been adopted by some historians as a means of assessing and exploring the possible outcomes if certain events had not occurred or had occurred in a different way. This is somewhat similar to the [[Alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] genre in fiction.

Lists of false or dubious historical resources and [[historical myths]] that were once popular and widespread, or have becomes so, have also been prepared.

</id>
<text>
{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}}There are many '''Schools of History''', each reflecting different [[historiography|historiographical]] approaches to the subject.
Note that a &quot;School&quot; of [[History]] is neither a physical structure nor an educational establishment, but is a term applied to a group of like-minded academics.

Historians may or may not &quot;officially&quot; subscribe to one or more schools. They may also lean toward one, or, over the course of a career, change their stance.

Some schools have become largely defunct, due to being discredited.

==Schools based on differing philosophies==
*[[Annales School]]
*[[Marxist historiography]]
*[[Whig history]]

==Schools focusing on history through another discipline==
*[[Historical school of economics]]
*[[German Historical School]] (law)

* '''[[Archive]]''' - A collection of documents and records
* '''[[Cultural artifact|Artifact]]''' - A material object of a culture such as a tool, an article of clothing or a prepared food
* '''[[Audience]]''' ? A class of entity for whom the resource is intended or useful
* '''[[Autobiography]]''' - An individual's account of their life
* '''[[Auxiliary sciences of history]]''' - A set of specialist scholarly disciplines which help evaluate and use historical sources, and which may be used to support historical research.
* '''[[Available]]''' ? Date (often a range) that the resource became or will become available
* '''[[Avalonia]]''' - A separate plate in the Early Paleozoic consisting of much of Northern Europe, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and some coastal parts of New England

&lt;/div&gt;

== B ==
&lt;div style=&quot;-moz-column-count: 2; column-count: 2;&quot;&gt;

* '''[[Baltica]]''' - A separate continental plate of the Early Paleozoic composed of the United Kingdom, Scandinavia, European Russia and Central Europe; named for the Baltic Sea
* '''[[Barbarian]]''' - A Greek word adopted by the Romans to refer to any people who did not adopt the Roman way of life. It is said to have come originally from the sound bar-bar, which, according to the Greeks, was supposed to be the noise that people made when speaking foreign languages
* '''[[Bering Land Bridge]]''' - The vast tundra plain that was exposed between Asia and North America during the Last Glacial Maximum, about 21,000 years ago; it served as a migration route for people, animals, and plants. Also known as [[Beringia]]

* '''[[Blitzkrieg]]''' - German for 'lightning war'. A military strategy used by the Germans at the beginning of World War II to achieve victory through a series of quick offensives, especially in Belgium, Holland and France. After an initial bombardment, armour and motorised infantry were mobilised rapidly to break the weakest parts of the enemy line
* '''[[Bolsheviks]]''' - Having split from the Russian Socialist movement in 1903, the Bolsheviks ('Majority') developed into a small, tightly organised, revolutionary Marxist group led by Lenin, for whom violence was a legitimate instrument of power. In November 1917, they took control of a chaotic Russia, becoming the de facto rulers after the subsequent civil war. They then renamed themselves the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU)
* '''[[Book Review]]''' - A critical examination of a text, usually including a summary of the work and opposing views
* '''[[Bourgeoisie]]''' - The capitalist class (see capitalism below) that came to be known as the middle class, between the aristocracy and the working class.

The term 'bourgeois' is used derogatorily to describe anything considered humdrum, unimaginative and/or selfishly materialistic
* '''[[Bronze Age]]''' - In Britain, this was the period ? from about 2300 to 700 BC ? when metal first began to be widely used, possibly as a result of the increase in contact with Europe. However, various types of stone, particularly flint, remained very important for long after metal became available. The Bronze Age saw the introduction of cremation of the dead and burials in round barrows. The later (and best known) phases of construction at Stonehenge also date from this period

Tiberius and Caligula inherited it by adoption as well. Later Roman emperors acquired the name upon their succession or when they were formally adopted as heirs
* '''[[Cathaysian Terranes]]''' - A set of small landmasses that developed in tropical to subtropical latitudes on the eastern side of Pangea during the Permian and Triassic, includes modern North China (Sino-Korea), South China (Yangtze), Eastern Qiangtang, Tarim, and Indochina.
* '''[[Cimmerian Terranes]]''' - An archipelago of small landmasses that developed in tropical and subtropical latitudes on the eastern side of Pangea during the Triassic, blocks that comprised it include modern Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Tibet, and Malaysia; also called [[Cimmeria]]

&lt;/div&gt;

== E ==

&lt;div style=&quot;-moz-column-count: 2; column-count: 2;&quot;&gt;

* '''[[Encyclopedia]]''' - A written reference work, composed of informative articles arranged alphabetically. These can either focus on a particular subject or, in the case of the Encyclop?dia Britannica, on everything
* '''[[Euramerica]]''' - A supercontinent that existed in the Late Silurian through Devonian, formed by the collision of Baltica, Laurentia, and Avalonia; included modern North America, Greenland, Scandinavia, and Europe; also called the ?Old Red Continent? for the red color of its oxidized deposits

== G ==

&lt;div style=&quot;-moz-column-count: 2; column-count: 2;&quot;&gt;

*  '''[[Gondwana]]''' - A supercontinent that existed from Cambrian to Jurassic time, mainly composed of South America, Africa, Madagascar, India, Antarctica, and Australia
&lt;/div&gt;

== H ==

&lt;div style=&quot;-moz-column-count: 2; column-count: 2;&quot;&gt;

* '''[[History]]''' - Although commonly used to refer to events which happened earlier in time, 'history' in academic study is either the study of the past or the product of our attempts to understand the past, rather than the past itself
* '''[[Historian]]''' - An individual who studies the past
* '''[[Historiography]]''' - Either the methods and principles used in the study of history, or the written result
&lt;/div&gt;

== I ==

'''Recorded history''' is the period in [[history of the world]] after [[prehistory]]. It has been written down using [[language]], or recorded using other means of communication. It starts around the [[4th millennium BC]], with the [[Invention of writing|invention]] of [[writing]].

==Historical accounts==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
Recorded history begins with the accounts of the ancient world by antiquity's own historians. The earliest [[Chronology|chronologies]] date back to [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Sumer]]) and [[ancient Egypt]] ([[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|Early Dynastic]]). Some of the more notable ancient historians include: [[Josephus Flavius]], [[Herodotus]], [[Thucydides]], [[Polybius]], [[Manetho]] ([[Greek historiography]]), [[Zuo Qiuming]], [[Sima Qian]] ([[Chinese historiography]]), [[Livy]], [[Sallust]], [[Plutarch]], [[Tacitus]], [[Suetonius]] ([[Roman historiography]]).  Although valuable, these accounts can be biased, and should be used with caution.

In pre-modern societies, [[epic poetry]], [[mythography]], collections of legends, and religious texts  were often treated as sources of historical information, and so one may see references to such writers as [[Homer]], [[Vyasa]], [[Valmiki]] and to such works as the biblical [[Book of Exodus]] as historical sources.
===Sources===
{{main|Primary source|Secondary source|Tertiary source}}
[[Primary source]]s are firsthand written evidence of history made at the time of the event by someone who was present. They have been described as those sources closest to the origin of the information or idea under study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.umd.edu/guides/primary-sources.html &quot;Primary, secondary and tertiary sources&quot;]; [http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml &quot;Library Guides: Primary, secondary and tertiary sources&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; These types of sources have been said to provide researchers with &quot;direct, unmediated information about the object of study.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Intellectual history

<text>
''Note: this article concerns the discipline of intellectual history, and not its object, the whole span of human thought since the [[invention of writing]]. For clarifications about the [[global intellectual history|latter topic]], please consult the writings of the [[Intellectual_history#Prominent_Individuals|intellectual historians listed here]] and entries on individual thinkers.'''''Intellectual history''' refers to the [[history]] of human thoughts in [[writing|written form]] {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}. This history cannot be considered without the knowledge of the men and women who created, discussed, wrote about and in other ways were concerned with [[idea]]s. ''Intellectual history'' is closely related to the [[history of philosophy]] and the [[history of ideas]]. Its central premise is that ideas do not develop in isolation from the people who create and use them and that one must study [[idea]]s not as abstract propositions but in terms of the [[culture]], lives and historical contexts that produced them.

''Intellectual history'' aims to understand ideas from the past by understanding them in context. The term 'context' in the preceding sentence is ambiguous: it can be political, cultural, intellectual and social. One can read a text both in terms of a chronological context (for example, as a contribution to a discipline or tradition as it extended over time) or in terms of a contemporary intellectual moment (for example, as participating in a debate particular to a certain time and place). Both of these acts of contextualization are typical of what intellectual historians do, nor are they exclusive. Generally speaking, intellectual historians seek to place concepts and texts from the past in multiple contexts.

It is important to realize that ''intellectual history'' is not just the history of intellectuals. It studies ideas as they are expressed in texts, and as such is different from other forms of [[cultural history]] which deal also with visual and other non-verbal forms of evidence. Any written trace from the past can be the object of intellectual history. The concept of the [[intellectual]] is relatively recent, and suggests someone professionally concerned with thought. Instead, anyone who has put pen to paper to explore her thoughts can be the object of intellectual history. A famous example of an intellectual history of a non-canonical thinker is [[Carlo Ginzburg]]'s study of a 16th-century Italian miller, Menocchio, in his seminal work ''[[The Cheese and the Worms]]''.

Although the field emerged from European disciplines of [[Kulturgeschichte]] and [[Geistesgeschichte]], the historical study of ideas has engaged not only western intellectual traditions, but others as well including, but not limited to, those in the [[Far East]], [[Near East]] and [[Africa]]. Increasingly, historians are calling for a [[global intellectual history]] that will show the parallels and interrelations in the history of thought of all human societies. Another important trend has been the [[history of the book]] and of [[Reading (process)|reading]], which has drawn attention to the material aspects of how books were designed, produced, distributed and read.

==Intellectual historiography==
Intellectual history as a self-conscious discipline is a relatively recent phenomenon. It has precedents, however, in the [[history of philosophy]], the [[history of ideas]], and in [[cultural history]] as practiced since [[Jacob Burckhardt|Burckhardt]] or indeed since [[Voltaire]]. The history of the human mind, as it was called in the eighteenth century, was of great concern to scholars and philosophers, and their efforts can in part be traced to [[Francis Bacon]]?s call for what he termed a literary history in his [[The Advancement of Learning]]. However, the discipline of intellectual history as it is now understood emerged only in the immediate postwar period, in its earlier incarnation as ?the [[history of ideas]]? under the leadership of [[Arthur Lovejoy]], the founder of the [[Journal of the History of Ideas]]. Since that time, [[Lovejoy]]?s formulation of ?unit-ideas? has been discredited and replaced by more nuanced and more historically sensitive accounts of intellectual activity, and this shift is reflected in the replacement of the phrase [[history of ideas]] by ''intellectual history''.

In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[history of political thought]] has been a particular focus since the late 1960s and is associated especially with the Faculty of History at the [[University of Cambridge]], where until recently such scholars as [[John Dunn (political theorist)|John Dunn]] and [[Quentin Skinner]] studied European political thought in its historical context, emphasizing the emergence and development of such concepts as the state and freedom. [[Quentin Skinner|Skinner]] in particular is renowned for his provocative methodological essays, which were and are widely read by philosophers and practitioners of other humanistic disciplines, and did much to give prominence to the practice of intellectual history. The [[University of Sussex]] in the UK has also achieved a reputation in this field of study, and the Sussex emphasis on broad interdisciplinary study has been particularly useful in relevant teaching and research.

In the United States, intellectual history is understood more broadly to encompass many different forms of intellectual output, not just the history of political ideas, and it includes such fields as the history of historical thought, associated especially with [[Anthony Grafton]] of [[Princeton University]] and [[J.G.A. Pocock]] of [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Despite the prominence of early modern intellectual historians (those studying the age from the [[Renaissance]] to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), the intellectual history of the modern period has also been the locus of intense and creative output on both sides of the Atlantic. Prominent examples of such work include [[Louis Menand]]?s [[The Metaphysical Club]] and [[Martin Jay]]?s [[The Dialectical Imagination]].

In continental Europe, equivalents of intellectual history can be found. An example is [[Reinhart Koselleck]]?s ''Begriffsgeschichte'' (history of concepts), though there are methodological differences between the work of Koselleck and his followers and the work of Anglo-American intellectual historians.

| quote       = Enlightenment was a desire for human affairs to be guided by rationality rather than by faith, superstition, or revelation; a belief in the power of human reason to change society and liberate the individual from the restraints of custom or arbitrary authority; all backed up by a world view increasingly validated by science rather than by religion or tradition. .}}&lt;/ref&gt; All this circumstances provided suitable surrounding for development of universalistic, liberal and rational global perspectives in studies of society and its past and writing historical texts.

In his ''Essay on customs (1756)'' [[Voltaire]] studied development of civilization in the world with universal perspective, rejecting tradition, Christian and national frames. He was significantly influenced by [[Jacques-B?nigne Bossuet]] and his work ''Discourse on the Universal history (1682)'' when he was first who seriously attempted to write history of the world, without limits imposed by nation or religion, emphasizing economical, cultural and political history. [[Imanuel Kant]] developed idea about universally applicable moral imperatives in his work ''Perpetual Peace (1795)'' and designed a plan for establishing [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] liberal order which would result with perpetual [[peace]]. Universalism of 18th century  created ideology which in modern form could be identified as [[Civil society|modern civil society]].

Emerging of modern historiography is connected with German universities in 19th century and significant influence of [[Leopold von Ranke]] who insisted on objectivity and systematic use of historical documents in shape of authentic primary sources and his credo was to perform reconstruction of the past &quot;as it was&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;A. G. Hopkins, p.2 &quot;Leopold von Ranke founded historical research on the systematic use of documentary evidence, on reconstructing the past `as it was', and on the ideal of objectivity.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Ranke's universal precepts in virtually all his works were, however, applied almost exclusively to the history of states and nations .&lt;ref&gt;A. G. Hopkins, p.2 &quot; These were
universal precepts. In practice, however, they were applied almost exclusively to the history of states and nation states in Europe,.... Virtually all of Ranke's own work,... was devoted to these themes.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes of Nationalization of history ==
Though nationalization of history could probably be traced from the earliest phases of creating historical works, it was period after [[French revolution]] that creating of historical works started to be strongly influenced by national perspectives, and that perspective gradually became globally dominant with its culmination during 19th and at the beginning of 20th century. Nationalism was estimated as proper perspective in such extent, that nationalization of history remained unnoticed till recently (1980s and 1990s) and was not studied in historiography in scale that would correspond to its significance.

Many various reasons, depending on the circumstances, caused nationalization of history. Probably most important is [[Romantic nationalism|national revival]], which important element was nationalized history,&lt;ref&gt;Kasianov, Terr; p. 7, &quot;In some countries nationalization of history was part of &quot;invention of tradition&quot;, while in others it was an element of so called &quot;national renaissance&quot; or &quot;national awakening&quot; ..&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; that resulted with emerging of modern [[nations]] and [[Nation state|nation-states]], mostly during 19th century. With emerging of national states, global universal approach in writing history lost ground to the nation state and was very much captured by it even in significant part of 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;A. G. Hopkins, p. 2 &quot;Nevertheless, the cosmopolitan ideal lost ground to the nation state in the nineteenth century and for the greater part of the twentieth century too, and was to a large degree captured by it.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Professionalization and institutionalization of history|The professionalization and institutionalization of history]] that took part in nation state's institutions during 19th and first half of 20th century was closely connected with process of history's increasing nationalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

After [[First World War]] was finished, in some cases during establishment of new frontiers, there was principle of national self-determination taken in consideration during frontier [[Demarcation line|demarcation]]. Therefore it was necessary to establish national historical character of certain territories and settlements, like in case between Germany and Poland and Versailles treaty when numerous historians prepared short studies in attempt to support territory demands based of Germany or Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

After [[Second World War]] and process of [[decolonization]], process of establishing new countries that gave additionally stimulated nationalization of history because &quot;new [[flags]] requested new histories&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;A.

== Renationalization of history ==
If first phase of nationalization of history was forcibly suppressed by anational ideology ([[communism]]) or traumatic losing of wars ([[Japan]], [[Germany]], ...) there can be second phase, [[renationalization of history]], on usually changed basis and perspective of nationalism.

=== Renationalization of history on Ukrainian example ===
Nationalization of history in [[Ukraine]] had two separate phases:&lt;ref&gt;Kasianov, Terr, p. 7, &quot;Ukraine experienced nationalization of history in two stages. The first began in mid-nineteenth century and reached its heights in the creation of grand narrative, Mykhailo Hrushevsky's ?History of Ukraine - Rus?. The tradition of historical writings that emerged at this stage persisted in Ukrainian Marxist historiography until the end of Second World War.... In diasporas historiography it turned it into canon, a true credo. The second stage began in 1980s and still continuing. .... It is taking place under state sponsorship and is integral part of nationalization of the state.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''First phase'' began at the middle of 19th century and reached its culmination in [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]]'s ?History of Ukraine - Rus'?. This phase lasted till the end of [[Second World War]] when it was stopped because of political changes in Soviet Union, while in [[diasporas]] Hrushevsky's text had [[cult]] status.
* ''Second phase'' started at the 1980s and still (2010) lasts, as consequence of direct state sponsorship becoming integral part of nationalization of the state. At the beginning, it was not so intensive, but after its turning point on August 24, 1991, it achieved special purposes: to legitimize newly established [[state (polity)|state]] and its governing elites, establishing territorial and chronological conceptions of [[Ukrainian nation]], and to confirm appropriateness of its existence as legal successor in the consciousness of its citizens and neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Kasianov, Terr,p. 11, &quot;Nationalized history began to fulfil important instrumental functions: legitimize newly established state and its attendant elite, establishing territorial and chronological conceptions of Ukrainian nation, and to confirm nations appropriateness of that nations existence as legal successor in the consciousness of its citizens and neighbours alike.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

First phase chronologically coincided with process of &quot;rediscovery of tradition&quot; and [[Romantic nationalism|national revival]] that captured whole Europe, while second phase takes place in period of globalization, vanishing cultural frontiers and aggressive international forms of [[mass culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Kasianov, Terr, p. 7,&quot;... unlike the previous stage, that coincided with general European phenomenon of &quot;invention of tradition&quot; and the development of the nations, the present stage is unfolding in the era of globalization, fading the cultural boundaries and large-scale aggression of the international forms of mass culture.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Local history

<id>

<text>
{{Globalize|date=December 2010}}'''Local history''' is the study of [[history]] in a geographically local context and it often concentrates on the [[local community]]. It incorporates [[cultural history|cultural]] and [[social history|social]] aspects of history. Historic plaques are one form of documentation of significant occurrences in the past and [[Oral history|oral histories]] are another. Local history is often documented by local historical societies or groups that form to preserve a local historic building or other historic site. Many works of local history are compiled by amateur historians working independently or archivists employed by various organizations. An important aspect of local history is the publication and cataloguing of documents preserved in local or national records which relate to particular areas.
==Geographically contexts==
Local history tends to be less documented than other types, with fewer books and artifacts than that of a country or continent. Many local histories are recorded as oral tales or stories and so are more vulnerable than more well known issues. Artifacts of local history are often collected in local history museums, which may be housed in a historic house or other building. Individual historic sites are inherently local, although they may have national or world history importance as well. Many however have litlle overall historical impact but add depth to the local area.

===United Kingdom===
The [[British Association for Local History]] in the [[United Kingdom]] encourages and assists in the study of local history as an academic discipline and as a leisure activity by both individuals and groups. Most historic counties in England have record societies and archaeological and historical societies which coordinate the work of historians and other researchers concerned with that area.

Local history in the UK took a long time to be accepted as an academic discipline. In the 18th and 19th centuries, it was widely regarded as an [[antiquarian]] pursuit, suitable for country parsons. The [[Victoria County History|Victoria History of the Counties of England]] project begun in 1899 in honour of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] with the aim of creating an encyclopaedic history of each of the [[historic counties of England]]. The project is coordinated by the [[Institute of Historical Research]] at the [[University of London]]. The first academic post related to local history was at [[Reading University]] which appointed a research fellow in local history in 1908. There was a department of local history (but without a professor) at [[Leicester University]] from 1947. HPR Finberg was the first Professor of English Local History. He was appointed by Leicester in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Local History: Objective and Pursuit|first=HPR|last=Finberg|first2=VHT|last2=Skipp|publisher=David &amp; Charles|year=1967|pages=46?70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local history continues to be neglected as an academic subject within universities. Academic local historians are often found within a more general department of history or in continuing education.

Local history is rarely taught as a separate subject in British schools. In 1908, a Board of Education circular had urged that schools should pay attention &quot;to the history of the town and district&quot; in which they were situated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Local History: Objective and Pursuit|first=HPR|last=Finberg|first2=VHT|last2=Skipp|publisher=David &amp; Charles|year=1967|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, the Ministry of Education suggested schools should use local material to illustrate national themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Local History: Objective and Pursuit|first=HPR|last=Finberg|first2=VHT|last2=Skipp|publisher=David &amp; Charles|year=1967|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the current [[National Curriculum]], pupils at level 4 are expected to &quot;show their knowledge and understanding of local, national and international history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://curriculum.qcda.gov.uk/key-stages-3-and-4/subjects/key-stage-3/history/Level-descriptions/index.aspx National Curriculum - level descriptions]&lt;/ref&gt;'''

===United States===
In the [[United States of America]], local history is usually concentrated on any history of the place and people from a particular [[village]] or [[township]]. Several villages and townships would comprise one county or county history. Library records are often divided by State, then county, then township/local history. The American Local History Network (ALHN) in the [[USA]] provides a focus for accessing independent genealogical and historical resources.

In the United States, 79,000 historic sites are identified as listings on its [[National Register of Historic Places]].  State and local municipalities often have additional landmark designations to cover sites of more purely local interest.

In addition, many regional and state [[historical societies]] maintain regional history and actively seek out missing historical collections.

===Russia, Ukraine and the former Soviet Union===
In the USSR, Russia and Russian-speaking post-Soviet states local history is known as ''krayevedenie'' and taught in primary schools. There are also local history museums known as ''krayevedcheskie muzei''.

In [[Ukraine]], the study of local history is known as ''krayeznavstvo'' ({{lang-uk|[[:uk:????????????|????????????]]}}).

==Artistic genre uses ==
The Scottish novel, ''[[The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner]]'' (1824) by [[James Hogg]], a dark study of criminal psychology and religious fanaticism, is essentially structured in all respects as a local history publication of the kind fashionable in [[Scotland]] in Hogg's lifetime.

Historical sociology

{{sociology}}'''Historical sociology''' is a branch of [[sociology]] focusing on how [[society|societies]] develop through [[history]]. It looks at how [[social structure]] that many regard as natural are in fact shaped by complex [[social process]]es. The structure in turn shapes institutions and organizations, and they affect the society - resulting in phenomena ranging from [[gender bias]], [[income inequality]] and [[war]].
Contemporary historical sociology is primarily concerned with how the [[State (polity)|state]] has developed since the [[Middle Ages]], analyzing relations between states, classes, economic and political systems.

==The use of history in sociology==
A common phrase regarding this subject is &quot;Sociology is history with the hard work left out; history is sociology with the brains left out&quot;. As time has passed, History and Sociology have historically developed into two different specific academic disciplines. Historical data was used and is used today in mainly these three ways. There are many other ways and Sociologists can add different theories to it. The first one is: Examining a theory through a Parallel investigation. To correspond with the natural-science conceptions of laws, and to look at, or apply various historical material where you gather your resources in order to prove the theory that is applied. Or on the other hand sociologists for the parallel investigation theory could apply the theory to certain cases of investigation but in a different modalities of a more widely used process.The second theory that Sociologists mainly use: applying and contrasting certain events or policies. Analyzed by their specific, or what makes them in unique quality of a composition, certain events used by the Sociologist for comparative data can be contrasted and compared. For interpretive Sociologists it is very common for them to use the 'Verstehen' tradition.  And lastly, the third way sociologists typically relate is by taking a look at the causalities from a macro point of view. This is Mill's method: &quot; a) principle of difference: a case with effect and cause present is contrasted with a case with effect and cause absent; and b) principle of agreement: cases with same effects are compared in terms of their (ideally identical) causes. There is an important debate on the usefulness of Mill?s method for sociological research, which relates to the fact that historical research is often based on only few cases and that many sociological theories are probabilistic, not deterministic.&lt;ref&gt;Deflem, Mathieu. 1997. &quot;On the Methodology of Historical Sociology: Scattered Notes&lt;/ref&gt;. Today, historical sociology is measured by a conjunction of questions that are rich in detail&lt;ref&gt;Clemens, Elizabeth S. &quot;Toward a Historicized Sociology: Theorizing Events, Processes, and Emergence.&quot; EBSCOhost. Web. Oct.-Nov. 2010. &lt;http://ezp.tccd.edu:2321/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;hid=119&amp;sid=cd26f66e-45f2-493d-804f-c67b713823ae%40sessionmgr114&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=pbh&amp;AN=26613934&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Path dependence in historical sociology==
[[Path dependence]] to some Sociologists is the theory that events that happened in past, have some or a lot of influence on events that happen in the future. However the Sociologist Mahoney has a different defintion of path dependence. This theory suggests that &quot;process, sequence, and temporality&quot; have a valid reason for affecting path dependence and the meaning of past historical events. There are three path-dependent analyses with an explanation to how each theory works. &quot;1) the study of causal processes that are especially sensitive, in a sequence, to early historical events, which are more important than later events; 2) these events are contingent occurrences that cannot be explained by prior events or initial conditions; and 3) that once contingent events take place, the path dependent sequence becomes a deterministic pattern.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, James. &quot;Path Dependence in Historical Sociology.&quot; Welcome to the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of South Carolina. 2007. Web. 2 Nov. 2010. &lt;http://www.cas.sc.edu/socy/faculty/deflem/zcomphistnotes.html#problems&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The debate over general theory in sociology==
A sociologist James Mahoney revisited the debate over [[general theory]] in Historical Sociology. By bridging the gaps of different assumptions, casual agents and causual mechanisms are connected to the empirical analysis, and this is seen as the general theory. &quot;...the debate over general theory in historical sociology with the goal of clarifying the use of this kind of theory in empirical research. General theories are defined as postulates about causal agents and causal mechanisms that are linked to empirical analysis through bridging assumptions. These theories can contribute to substantive knowledge by helping analysts derive new hypotheses, integrate existing findings, and explain historical outcomes. To illustrate these applications, the article considers five different general theories that have guided or could guide historical sociology: functionalist, rational choice, power, neo-Darwinian, and cultural theories. A key conclusion that emerges is that scholars must evaluate both the overall merits of general theory and the individual merits of specific general theories&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, James. &quot;Revisiting General Theory in Historical Sociology.&quot; EBSCOhost. Web. 4 Nov. 2010. &lt;http://ezp.tccd.edu:2321/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;hid=119&amp;sid=de4d24a8-0f77-45bf-86a0-e3e193c025e4%40sessionmgr115&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=pbh&amp;AN=16144478&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>
{{Sociology}}'''Comparative Historical Research''' is a method of social science that examines historical events in order to create explanations that are valid beyond a particular time and place, either by direct comparison to other historical events, theory building, or reference to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Mission of the Comparative and Historical Sociology Section of the American Sociological Association. [http://www2.asanet.org/sectionchs/sectioninfo.html www2.asanet.org/sectionchs/sectioninfo.html] (Accessed 15 December 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, it involves comparisons of social processes across times and places. It overlaps with [[historical sociology]]. While the disciplines of [[History]] and [[Sociology]] have always been connected, they have connected in different ways at different times (see Major Researchers below). This form of research may use any of several theoretical orientations. It is distinguished by the types of questions it asks, not the theoretical framework it employs (see Illustrations below).
== Major researchers ==
Some commentators have identified three waves of historical comparative research.&lt;ref&gt;J. Adams, E.S. Clemens, and A.S. Orloff. 2005. ''Remaking Modernity: Politics, History, and Sociology''. Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The first wave of historical comparative research concerned how societies came to be [[Modernity|modern]], i.e. based on individual and rational action, with exact definitions varying widely. Some of the major researchers in this mode were [[Alexis de Tocqueville]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[Democracy In America]]''. 1969 [1835-40]. Trans. George Lawrence. Perennial Classics.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, &quot;[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon|The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte]].&quot; 1979 [1852]. In [[Marx/Engels Collected Works]], Vol. 11. International Publishers. pg. 99-197.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emile Durkheim]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[The Division of Labor in Society]]''. 1984 [1893]. Trans. W.D. Halls. The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Weber]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[Economy and Society|Economy And Society: An Outline of Interpretive Sociology]]''. 1968 [1922]. Ed. Guenther Roth and Claus Wittich. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[W.E.B. DuBois]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''The Suppression of the African Slave Trade to the United States of America 1638-1870''. In W.E.B. DuBois Writings. Library of America. pg. 1-356.&lt;/ref&gt; The second wave reacted to a perceived ahistorical body of theory and sought to show how social systems were not static, but developed over time.&lt;ref&gt;D. Smith. 1991. ''The Rise of Historical Sociology''. Temple University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable authors of this wave include [[Barrington Moore, Jr.]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy: Lord and Peasant in the Making of the Modern World''. 1966. Beacon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theda Skocpol]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[States and Social Revolutions|States and Social Revolutions: A Comparative Analysis of France, Russia, and China]]''. 1979. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Tilly]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Coercion, Capital, and European States, AD 990-1992''. 1992. Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Mann (sociologist)|Michael Mann]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''The Sources of Social Power'', Vols. 1-2. 1986-93. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Mark Gould.&lt;ref&gt;''Revolution in the Development of Capitalism: The Coming of the English Revolution''. 1987. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have placed the Annales school and Pierre Bourdieu in this general group, despite their stylistic differences.&lt;ref&gt;For example, P. Bourdieu. 1988 [1984]. ''Homo Academicus''. Trans. Peter Collier. Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The current wave of historical comparative research sociology is often but not exclusively post-structural in its theoretical orientation. Influential current authors include Julia Adams,&lt;ref&gt;For example, &quot;The Rule of the Father: Patriarchy and Patrimonialism in Early Modern Europe.&quot; 2005. In ''Max Weber's Economy and Society: A Critical Companion''. Ed. C. Camic, P.S. Gorski, and D.M. Trubek. Stanford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Anne Laura Stoler,&lt;ref&gt;''Carnal Knowledge and Imperial Power: Race and the Intimate in Colonial Rule''. 2002. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Gorski,&lt;ref&gt;''The Disciplinary Revolution: Calvinism and the Rise of the State in Early Modern Europe''. 2003. University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and James Mahoney.&lt;ref&gt;J. Mahoney. 2003. &quot;Knowledge Accumulation in Comparative Historical Research: The Case of Democracy and Authoritarianism.&quot; In ''Comparative Historical Analysis in the Social Sciences''. Ed. J. Mahoney and D. Rueschemeyer. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
There are four major methods that researchers use to collect historical data. These are archival data, secondary sources, running records, and recollections. The archival data, or primary sources, are typically the resources that researchers rely most heavily on. Archival data includes official documents and other items that would be found in archives, museums, etc.  Secondary sources are the works of other historians who have written history. Running records are ongoing series of statistical or other sorts of data, such as census data, ship's registries, property deeds, etc. Finally recollections include sources such as autobiographies, memoirs or diaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.ncwc.edu/toconnor/308/308lect09.htm |title=UNKNOWN |accessdate=2007-11-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071031062230/http://faculty.ncwc.edu/toconnor/308/308lect09.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four stages, as discussed by Schutt, to systematic qualitative comparative historical studies: (1) develop the premise of the investigation, identifying events, concepts, etc., that may explain the phenomena; (2) choose the case(s) (location- nation, region) to examine; (3) use what Theda Skocpol has termed as &quot;interpretive historical sociology&quot; and examine the similarities and the differences; and (4) based on the information gathered, propose a casual explanation for the phenomena.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schutt&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Schutt |first=R. K. |year=2006 |title=Investigating the Social World: The Process and Practice of Research |location=London |publisher=SAGE Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key issues in methods for historical comparative research stem from the incomplete nature of historical data, the complexity and scale of the social systems, and the nature of the questions asked. Historical data is a difficult set of data to work with due to multiple factors. This data set can be very biased, such as diaries, memoirs, letters, which are all influenced not only by the person writing them, that person's world view but can also, logically, be linked to that individual's socioeconomic status.  In this way the data can be corrupt/skewed. Historical data regardless or whether it may or may not be biased (diaries vs. official documents) is also vulnerable to time. Time can destroy fragile paper, fade ink until it is illegible, wars, environmental disasters can all destroy data and special interest groups can destroy mass amounts of data to serve a specific purpose at the time they lived, etc. Hence, data is naturally incomplete and can lead social scientists to many barriers in their research. Often historical comparative research is a broad and wide reaching topic such as how democracy evolved in three specific regions. Tracking how democracy developed is a daunting task for one country or region let alone three. Here the scale of the social system, which is attempting to be studied, is overwhelming but also the complexity is extreme. Within each case there are multiple different social systems that can affect the development of a society and its political system. The factors must be separated and analyzed so that causality can be attained. It is causality that brings us to yet another key issue in methods for historical comparative research, the nature of the questions which are asked is attempting to propose causal relationships between a set of variables. Determining causality alone is a difficult task; coupled with the incomplete nature of historical data and the complexity and scale of the social systems being used to examine causality the task becomes even more challenging.

==Identifying features==
The three identifying issues of historical comparative research are causal relationships, processes over time, and comparisons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schutt&quot;/&gt;  As mentioned above causal relationships are difficult to support although we make causal assumptions daily. Schutt discusses the five criteria, which must be met in order to have a causal relationship. Of the five the first three are the most important: association, time order and nonspuriousness. Association simply means that between two variables; the change in one variable is related to the change in another variable. Time order refers to the fact that the cause (the independent variable) must be shown to have occurred first and the effect (the dependent variable) to have occurred second. Nonspuriousness says that the association between two variables is not because of a third variable. The final two criteria are; identifying a causal mechanism- how the connection/association among variables is thought to have occurred- and the context in which this association occurs. The deterministic causal approach requires that in every study, the independent and dependent variable have an association, and within that study every case (nation, region) the independent variable has an effect on the dependent variable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schutt&quot;/&gt;

[[John Stuart Mill]] devised five methods for systematically analyzing observations and making more accurate assumptions about causality. [[Mill's Methods]] discusses; direct method of agreement, method of difference, joint method of agreement and difference, method of residues and method of concomitant variations. Mill's methods are typically the most useful when the causal relationship is already suspected and can therefore be a tool for eliminating other explanations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophypages.com/lg/e14.htm |title=UNKNOWN |accessdate=2007-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some methodologists contend Mill's methods cannot provide proof that the variation in one variable was caused by the variation of another variable.

== Difficulties ==
There are several difficulties that historical comparative research faces. James Mahoney, one of the current leading figures in historical comparative research, identifies several of these in his book &quot;Comparative Historical Analysis in the Social Sciences.&quot; Mahoney highlights key issues such as how micro level studies can be incorporated into the macro level field of historical comparative research, issues ripe for historical comparative research that continue to remain overlooked, such as law, and the issue of whether historical comparative research should be approached as a science or approached as a history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mahoney&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahoney, |first=J |coauthors=Rueschemeyer, D. |year=2003 |title=Comparative historical analysis of the social sciences |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the more prevalent debates today, often debated between [[Theda Skocpol]], who sides with the historical approach, and Kiser and Hechter, who are proponents of the scientific view that should search for general causal principles.  Both Kiser and Hechter employ models within [[Rational Choice Theory]] for their general causal principles.  Historical researchers that oppose them (Skocpol, Summers, others) argue that Kiser and Hechter do not suggest many other plausible general theories, and thus it seems as though their advocacy for general theories is actually advocacy for their preferred general theory.  They also raise other criticisms of using rational choice theory in historical comparative research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://66.218.69.11/search/cache?ei=UTF-8&amp;p=kiser+hechter&amp;fr=yfp-t-501&amp;u=www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0226305651/hanswienholdsfan/&amp;w=kiser+hechter&amp;d=O27yYudmPd0K&amp;icp=1&amp;.intl=us |title=UNKNOWN |accessdate=2007-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role of general theory ===

In recent decades historical comparative researchers have debated the proper role of general theory.  Two of the main players in this debate have been Edgar Kiser and Michael Hechter.  They have argued that it is important to use a general theory in order to be able to test the results of the research that has been conducted.  They do not argue that one specific theory is better than the other just that a theory needs to be used.  Their chosen theory is rational choice.  One of the main problems is that everyone has a different concept of what a theory is and what makes something a theory.  Some of their opponents feel that any theory can be tested and they are arguing that some cannot be.  Kiser and Hecter do acknowledge that this is a growing field and that their perspective may change in the future.

==Illustrations==

The comparative-historical method can be clarified with a recent and highly-regarded example. In ''The Familial State'', Julia Adams draws on both original archival work and secondary sources to analyze how merchant families contested with noble families for influence in the early modern [[Dutch Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Adams. 2005. ''The Familial State: Ruling Families and Merchant Capitalism in Early Modern Europe''. Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Adams argues that those contests produced the political institutions that became the modern Dutch state. She frequently makes reference to [[England]] and [[France]], but the main topic is the Dutch Republic. Adams examines what earlier sociologists said about state formation in light of the Dutch case, finding there are decisive elements in the Dutch Republic, like patriarchal kinship structures in the ruling families, that aren't accounted for in the earlier theories. Adams draws on feminist theory, which was not originally intended to explain modern state formation, to create an expanded theory of how modern states came to be. This is an illustration of how comparative-historical analysis uses cases and theories together.

Elegant decay
</title>

{{Orphan|date=January 2011}}{{No footnotes|date=January 2012}}
'''Elegant Decay''' is the distinct cultural/historical concept that some places, and structures, become gradually more elegant, notable or beautiful as they decay, or fall into ruin, due to their historical, architectural and/or cultural significance. Although such reverence can often be merely in the opinion of individuals, it is true that certain cities, regions or even countries are more susceptible to the general concept due to past opulence, or their lengthy or enduring history or culture.

[[File:Rome Palatine Hill.jpg|thumb|360px|A bend in the path to the summit of Palatine Hill, in Rome, Italy]]

Contrary to the general interpretation that places or structures are more noteworthy in their newness, or older structures hold more value and interest in being historically restored to their original state, the concept of elegant decay is that in the slow degradation of the structures an inherent elegance, or beauty, emerges due to past historic importance. In more recent times, this concept has gradually become more important for regions to cultivate a more vibrant tourist industry.

==History==
[[File:Venice Windows.jpg|thumb|360px|A wall in Venice, Italy, slowly crumbles into a canal.]]

With its rich history, and centuries of past prestige and prominence, [[Western Europe]] has many places where elegant decay is notable, and celebrated, today. One of the most famous countries is Italy, due to its lengthy historic prominence in prehistoric, ancient, medieval and modern times. Possibly the most celebrated of Italian cities in elegant decay would be [[Venice]], largely due to the whole city slowly crumbling, and sinking, into the lagoon which it is in.

Although Western Europe holds many instances of elegant decay today, the New World also has places of crumbled reverence as well. Most notable in the United States may be the city and region around [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], with a historic fusion of cultures, and legacies of hatred and darkness. In the concept of elegant decay, there appears to sometimes be an element of impending doom to such places and structures, as Venice, Italy, slowly sinks, and New Orleans is always under threat of the tides.

It is of note that elegant decay is different in concept and plan than [[ruin value]], in which structures are planned to look beautiful in ruin from the early planning stages.
The concept of elegant decay is related to the concept of [[patina]].

'''Professionalization and institutionalization of history''' is term used in [[historiography]] to describe process of professionalization of the historical discipline with historians becoming professionals through process of special education, and genesis of [[Historical institutionalism|historical institutions]] they founded.== Professionalization of history ==
During process of [[professionalization]] of history being historian became not only occupation but [[profession]] of the highest integrity and competence. Professionalization of history is the process of acquiring the following characteristics of profession for occupation of historian:
# prolonged training in definable body of knowledge,
# a [[credential]] system,
# a [[code of ethics]],
# a [[self-government]]
# legislated access to particular [[labour market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

This process results with privileged access to financial and social rewards for its members.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''The professionalization of history in English Canada'', page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Institutionalization of history ==
The term [[institutionalisation]] is widely used in social theory to refer to the process of embedding something (for example a concept, a social role, a particular value or mode of behaviour) within an organisation, social system, or society as a whole.

A body politic comprises all the people in a particular country considered as a single group. The [[analogy]] is typically continued by reference to the apex of government as the [[head of state]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Body politic: political metaphor and political violence |author=A. D. Harvey |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=9781847182722}}&lt;/ref&gt; but may be extended to other anatomical parts, as in political readings of the [[Aesop's fable]] [[The Belly and the Members]]. The metaphor also appears in the French language as the ''corps-?tat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The body politic: corporeal metaphor in revolutionary France, 1770-1800 |author=Antoine de Baecque |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=1997 |isbn=9780804728171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The metaphor developed in [[Renaissance]] times, as the medical knowledge based upon the classical work of [[Galen]] was being challenged by new thinkers such as [[William Harvey]].  Analogies were made between the supposed causes of disease and disorder and their equivalents in the political field which were considered to be [[plague]]s or infections which might be remedied by [[purgative|purges]] and [[nostrum]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Foreign bodies and the body politic: discourses of social pathology in early modern England |author=Jonathan Harris |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |isbn=9780521594059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The concept can be seen in the [[Massachusetts Constitution of 1780]], which declares: &quot;The body politic is formed by a [[voluntary association]] of individuals; it is a [[social compact]] by which the whole people covenants with each citizen and each citizen with the whole people&quot; But it is summarized very simply in the words of the [[Declaration of Independence]], which posits as a self-evident truth &quot;that to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the [[consent of the governed]].&quot; [http://www.amazon.com/STILL-HOLD-THESE-TRUTHS-Rediscovering/dp/1935191926/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322101027&amp;sr=1-1]

{{About|practitioners of the scholarly pursuit of antiquarianism|the trade in old books|Bookselling|trading or collecting old objects|Antique}}[[Image:Musei Wormiani Historia.jpg|thumb|330px|[[Ole Worm]]'s [[cabinet of curiosities]], from ''Museum Wormianum,'' 1655.]]An '''antiquarian''' or '''antiquary''' (from the Latin ''antiquarius'', meaning pertaining to ancient times) is an [[aficionado]] or student of [[antiquities]] or things of the past. More specifically, the term is used for those who study [[history]] with particular attention to ancient objects of art or science, archaeological and historic [[Archaeological site|sites]], or historic [[archive]]s and [[manuscript]]s. The essence of antiquarianism is a focus on the [[Empiricism|empirical]] evidence of the past, and is perhaps best encapsulated in the motto adopted by the 18th-century antiquary, [[Sir Richard Hoare, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Colt Hoare]], &quot;We speak from facts not theory&quot;.

Today the term is often used in a pejorative sense, to refer to an excessively narrow focus on factual historical trivia, to the exclusion of a sense of historical context or process.

==History==
===Antiquarianism in ancient Rome===
In [[ancient Rome]], a strong [[mos maiorum|sense of traditionalism]] motivated an interest in studying and recording the &quot;monuments&quot; of the past; the [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan]] historian [[Livy]] uses the Latin ''monumenta'' in the sense of &quot;antiquarian matters.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''Ab Urbe Condita'' 7.3.7: cited also in the ''[[Oxford Latin Dictionary]]'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1982, 1985 reprinting), p. 1132, entry on ''monumentum'', as an example of meaning 4b, &quot;recorded tradition.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Books on antiquarian topics covered such subjects as the origin of customs, [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious rituals]], and [[Roman constitution|political institutions]]; genealogy; topography and landmarks; and [[etymology]]. [[Annals]] and [[Roman historiography|histories]] might also include sections pertaining to these subjects, but annals are chronological in structure, and [[Roman historiography|Roman histories]], such as those of Livy and [[Tacitus]], are both chronological and offer an overarching narrative and interpretation of events. By contrast, antiquarian works as a literary form are organized by topic, and any narrative is short and illustrative, in the form of [[anecdote]]s.

Major antiquarian [[Latin literature|Latin writers]] with surviving works include [[Varro]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Aulus Gellius]], and [[Macrobius]]. The Roman emperor [[Claudius]] published antiquarian works, none of which is extant. Some of [[Cicero]]'s treatises, particularly [[De Divinatione|his work on divination]], show strong antiquarian interests, but their primary purpose is the exploration of philosophical questions. Roman-era [[Ancient Greek literature|Greek writers]] also dealt with antiquarian material, such as [[Plutarch]]  in his ''Roman Questions''&lt;ref&gt;At [[LacusCurtius]], Bill Thayer presents an edition of the ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Roman_Questions*/home.html Roman Questions]'' based on the [[Loeb Classical Library]] translation. Thayer's edition can be browsed question-by-question in tabulated form, with direct links to individual topics.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'' of [[Athenaeus]]. The aim of Latin antiquarian works is to collect a great number of possible explanations, with less emphasis on arriving at a truth than in compiling the evidence. The antiquarians are often used as sources by the ancient historians, and many antiquarian writers are known only through these citations.&lt;ref&gt;This overview of Roman antiquarianism is based on [[T.P. Wiseman]], ''Clio's Cosmetics'' (Bristol: Phoenix Press, 2003, originally published 1979 by Leicester University Press), pp. 15?15, 45 ''et passim''; and ''A Companion to Latin Literature'', edited by Stephen Harrison (Blackwell, 2005), pp. 37?38, 64, 77, 229, 242?244 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval and early modern antiquarianism===
Despite the importance of antiquarian writing in the [[Latin literature|literature of ancient Rome]], some scholars view antiquarianism as emerging only in the [[Middle Ages]] (see [[History of archaeology]]).&lt;ref name=Daly-35&gt;{{citation|title=Egyptology: The Missing Millennium : Ancient Egypt in Medieval Arabic Writings|first=Okasha|last=El Daly|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2004|isbn=1-84472-063-2|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval antiquarians sometimes made collections of inscriptions or records of monuments, but the Varro-inspired concept of ''antiquitates'' among the Romans as the &quot;systematic collections of all the [[relic]]s of the past&quot; faded.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnaldo Momigliano]], &quot;Ancient History and the Antiquarian,&quot; ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' 13 (1950), p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; Antiquarianism's wider flowering is more generally associated with the [[Renaissance]], and with the critical assessment and questioning of [[Classical antiquity|classical]] texts undertaken in that period by [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholars. Textual criticism soon broadened into an awareness of the supplementary perspectives on the past which could be offered by the study of [[Numismatics|coins]], [[Epigraphy|inscriptions]] and other archaeological remains, as well as documents from medieval periods.  Antiquaries often formed collections of these and other objects; [[cabinet of curiosities]] is a general term for early collections, which often encompassed antiquities and more recent art, items of natural history, [[memorabilia]] and items from far-away lands.

[[Image:William Camden Clarenceux.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Camden]] (1551?1623), author of the ''Britannia'', wearing the [[tabard]] and [[chain of office]] of [[Clarenceux King of Arms]]. Originally published in the 1695 edition of ''Britannia''.]]
The importance placed on [[ancestor|lineage]] in [[Early modern period|early modern]] Europe meant that antiquarianism was often closely associated with [[genealogy]], and a number of prominent antiquaries (including [[Robert Glover (officer of arms)|Robert Glover]], [[William Camden]], [[William Dugdale]] and [[Elias Ashmole]]) held office as professional [[herald]]s. The development of genealogy as a &quot;scientific&quot; discipline (i.e. one that rejected unsubstantiated legends, and demanded high standards of proof for its claims) went hand-in-hand with the development of antiquarianism. Genealogical antiquaries recognised the evidential value for their researches of non-textual sources, including [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] and [[church monuments]].

Many [[Early modern period|early modern]] antiquaries were also [[Chorography|chorographers]]: that is to say, they recorded landscapes and monuments within regional or national descriptions. In England, some of the most important of these took the form of [[English county histories|county histories]].

In the context of the 17th-century [[scientific revolution]], and more specifically that of the  &quot;[[Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns]]&quot; in England and France, the antiquaries were firmly on the side of the &quot;Moderns&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levine, Battle of the Books&quot;&gt;Levine, ''Battle of the Books''.&lt;/ref&gt; They increasingly argued that empirical [[Primary source|primary]] evidence could be used to refine and challenge the received interpretations of history handed down from literary authorities.

===19th-21st centuries===
By the end of the 19th century, antiquarianism had diverged into a number of more specialized academic disciplines including [[archaeology]], [[art history]], [[numismatics]], [[sigillography]], [[philology]], [[Literary criticism|literary studies]] and [[diplomatics]]. Antiquaries had always attracted a degree of ridicule (see below), and since the mid-19th century the term has tended to be used most commonly in negative or derogatory contexts. Nevertheless, many practising antiquaries continue to claim the title with pride. In recent years, in a scholarly environment in which [[interdisciplinarity]] is increasingly encouraged, many of the established antiquarian societies (see below) have found new roles as facilitators for collaboration between specialists.

==Verbal distinctions==
===Antiquaries and antiquarians===
&quot;Antiquary&quot; was the usual term in English from the 16th to the mid-18th centuries to describe a person interested in antiquities (the word &quot;antiquarian&quot; being generally found only in an [[Adjective|adjectival]] sense). From the second half of the eighteenth century, however, &quot;antiquarian&quot; began to be used more widely as a noun, and today both forms are equally acceptable.

===Antiquaries and historians===
From the 16th to the 19th centuries, a clear distinction was perceived to exist between the interests and activities of the antiquary and the [[historian]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Levine, Battle of the Books&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, &quot;Erudition and the Idea of History&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levine, ''Humanism and History'', pp.&amp;nbsp;54?72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levine, ''Amateur and Professional'', pp.&amp;nbsp;28?30, 80-81.&lt;/ref&gt; The antiquary was concerned with the relics of the past (whether [[document]]s, [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] or [[Archaeological site|monuments]]), whereas the historian was concerned with the [[Narrative history|narrative]] of the past, and its political or moral lessons for the present. The skills of the antiquary tended to be those of the critical examination and interrogation of his sources, whereas those of the historian were those of the philosophical and literary reinterpretation of received narratives. These distinctions began to be eroded in the second half of the nineteenth century as the school of [[Empiricism|empirical]] source-based history championed by [[Leopold von Ranke]] began to find widespread acceptance, and today's historians employ the full range of techniques pioneered by the early antiquaries. Rosemary Sweet suggests that 18th-century antiquaries
:&quot;probably had more in common with the professional historian of the twenty-first century, in terms of methodology, approach to sources and the struggle to reconcile erudition with style, than did the authors of the grand narratives of national history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sweet, ''Antiquaries'', p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antiquarians, antiquarian books and antiques===
In many European languages, the word antiquarian (or its equivalent) has shifted in modern times to refer to a person who either trades in or collects rare and ancient [[Antiquarian bookseller|antiquarian books]]; or who trades in or collects [[Antique|antique objects]] more generally. In English, however, the word (either as antiquarian or antiquary) very rarely carries this sense. An antiquarian is primarily a ''student'' of ancient books, documents, artefacts or monuments. Many antiquarians have also built up extensive personal [[Collecting|collections]] in order to inform their studies, but a far greater number have not; and conversely many collectors of books or antiques would not regard themselves (or be regarded) as antiquarians.

[[Image:Rowlandson Death &amp; Antiquaries.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Thomas Rowlandson]]'s caricature, ''Death and the Antiquaries'', 1816. A group of antiquaries cluster eagerly around the exhumed corpse of a king, oblivious to the jealous figure of Death aiming his dart at one of them. The image was inspired by the opening of the tomb of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] in [[Westminster Abbey Burials and Memorials|Westminster Abbey]] by the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] in 1774.]]

==Pejorative associations==
Antiquaries often appeared to possess an unwholesome interest in death, decay, and the unfashionable; while their focus on obscure and arcane details meant that they seemed to lack an awareness both of the realities and practicalities of modern life, and of the wider currents of history. For all these reasons they frequently became objects of ridicule.&lt;ref&gt;B.S. Allen, ''Tides in English Taste (1619?1800)'', 2 vols (Cambridge, Mass., 1937), vol. 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;87?92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, ''Hobby-Horsical Antiquary'', esp. pp.&amp;nbsp;13?17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sweet, ''Antiquaries'', pp. xiii, 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The antiquary was satirised in [[John Earle (bishop)|John Earle]]'s ''Micro-cosmographie'' of 1628 (&quot;Hee is one that hath that unnaturall disease to bee enamour'd of old age, and wrinkles, and loves all things (as Dutchmen doe Cheese) the better for being mouldy and worme-eaten&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;John Earle, &quot;An Antiquarie&quot;, in ''Micro-cosmographie'' (London, 1628), sigs [B8]v-C3v.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Jean-Sim?on Chardin]]'s painting &quot;Le Singe Antiquaire&quot; (''c''.1726), in Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s novel ''[[The Antiquary]]'' (1816), in the caricatures of [[Thomas Rowlandson]], and in many other places. The word's resonances were close to those of modern terms for individuals with obsessive interests in technical minutiae, such as [[nerd]], [[Railfan|trainspotter]] or [[Anorak (slang)|anorak]].

In his essay &quot;On the Uses and Abuses of History for Life&quot; from his ''Untimely Meditations'', [[philosopher]] [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] examines three forms of [[history]]. One of these is [[antiquarian history]], an objectivising historicism which forges little or no creative connection between past and present. Nietzsche's [[philosophy of history]] had a significant impact on [[critical history]] in the 20th century.

C.R. Cheney, writing in 1956, observed that &quot;[a]t the present day we have reached such a pass that the word 'antiquary' is not always held in high esteem, while 'antiquarianism' is almost a term of abuse&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;C.R. Cheney, &quot;Introduction&quot;, in Levi Fox (ed.), ''English Historical Scholarship in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries'' (London, 1956), p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Professional historians still often use the term &quot;antiquarian&quot; in a pejorative sense, to refer to historical studies which seem concerned only to place on record trivial or inconsequential facts, and which fail to consider the wider implications of these, or to formulate any kind of argument. The term is also sometimes applied to the activities of amateur historians such as [[Historical reenactment|historical reenactors]], who may have a meticulous approach to reconstructing the costumes or [[material culture]] of past eras, but who are perceived to lack much understanding of the cultural values and historical contexts of the periods in question.

==Antiquarian societies==
A [[College of Antiquaries|College (or Society) of Antiquaries]] was founded in London in ''c''.1586, to debate matters of antiquarian interest. Members included [[William Camden]], [[Robert Bruce Cotton|Sir Robert Cotton]], [[John Stow]], [[William Lambarde]], [[Richard Carew (antiquary)|Richard Carew]] and others. This body existed till 1604, when it fell under suspicion of being political in its aims, and was abolished by King [[James I of England|James I]]. Papers read at their meetings are preserved in [[Cottonian library|Cotton's collections]], and were printed by [[Thomas Hearne]] in 1720 under the title ''A Collection of Curious Discourses'', a second edition appearing in 1771.

[[File:Soc Antiq 2010.JPG|thumb|right|The entrance to the premises of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]], at [[Burlington House]], [[Piccadilly]].]]
In 1707 a number of English antiquaries began to hold regular meetings for the discussion of their hobby and in 1717 the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] was formally reconstituted, finally receiving a charter from King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] in 1751. In 1780 King [[George III of Great Britain|George III]] granted the society apartments in [[Somerset House]], and in 1874 it moved into its present accommodation in [[Burlington House]]. The society was governed by a council of twenty and a president who is ''ex officio'' a trustee of the [[British Museum]].

The [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]] was founded in 1780 and had the management of a large national antiquarian museum in [[Edinburgh]].

The [[Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne]], the oldest provincial antiquarian society in England, was founded in 1813.

In [[Ireland]] a society was founded in 1849 called the Kilkenny Archaeological Society, holding its meetings at [[Kilkenny]]. In 1869 its name was changed to the Royal Historical and Archaeological Association of Ireland, and in 1890 to the [[Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland]], its office being transferred to [[Dublin]].

In [[France]] the ''[[Soci?t? des Antiquaires de France]]'' was formed in 1813 by the reconstruction of the ''Acad?mie Celtique'', which had existed since 1804.

The [[American Antiquarian Society]] was founded in 1812, with its headquarters at [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], [[Massachusetts]]. It had a library of upwards of 100,000 volumes and its transactions have been published bi-annually since 1820.

In [[Denmark]], the ''Kongelige Nordiske Oldskriftselskab'' (also known as ''La Soci?t? Royale des Antiquaires du Nord'' or the Royal Society of Northern Antiquaries) was founded at [[Copenhagen]] in 1825.

In [[Germany]] the ''Gesamtverein der Deutschen Geschichts und Altertumsvereine'' was founded in 1852.

Sinecure
</title>
<id>

</id>
<text>
{{Wiktionary}}A '''sinecure''' (from [[Latin]] ''sine'' = &quot;without&quot; and ''cura'' = &quot;care&quot;) means an office that requires or involves little or no responsibility, labour, or active service. The term originated in the medieval church, where it signified a post without any responsibility for the &quot;cure of souls&quot;, the regular liturgical and pastoral functions of a cleric, but came to be applied to any post, secular or ecclesiastical, that involved little or no actual work. Sinecures have historically provided a potent tool for governments or monarchs to distribute [[patronage]], while recipients are able to store up titles and easy salaries.

A sinecure is not necessarily a [[figurehead (political)|figurehead]], which generally requires active participation in government, albeit with a lack of power. A sinecure, by contrast, has no real day-to-day responsibilities, but may have [[de jure]] power.

A sinecure can also be given to an individual whose primary job is in another office, but requires a sinecure title to perform that job. For example, the [[Leader of the Government in the House of Commons (Canada)|Government House Leader]] in Canada is often given a sinecure ministry position so that he may become a member of the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]]. Similar examples are the [[Lord Privy Seal]] and the [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]] in the British cabinet. Other sinecures operate as [[legal fiction]]s, such as the British office of [[Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds]], used as a legal excuse for [[resignation from the British House of Commons|resigning from Parliament]].

==History==
[[File:Tizian 109.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Girolamo and cardinal [[Marco Corner]] investing Marco, abbot of [[Carrara]], with his [[benefice]], [[Titian]], ca 1520&lt;/center&gt;]]
''[[Sinecure]]'', properly a term of [[ecclesiastical law]] for a [[benefice]] without the cure of souls, in the [[Church of England|English Church]] arose when the [[rector]] had no cure of souls nor resided in the [[parish]], the work of the incumbent being performed by a [[vicar]]. Such sinecure rectories were expressly granted by the patron. They were abolished by [[parliament]] under the [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners]] Act of 1840.

Other ecclesiastical sinecures were certain [[cathedral]] dignities to which no spiritual functions attached or incumbencies where by reason of depopulation and the like, the parishioners disappeared or the parish church was allowed to decay. Such cases eventually ceased to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. M. Guasco, ''Storia del clero'', Laterza (1997), p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also used of any office or place to which salary emoluments or [[Dignitas (Roman concept)|dignity]] but no duties are attached. The British civil service and the royal household, for example, were loaded with innumerable offices which by lapse of time, had become sinecures and were only kept as the reward of political services or to secure voting power in parliament. They were prevalent in the 18th century, but were gradually abolished by statutes during that and the following centuries.

Below is a list of extant sinecures by Country.&lt;ref&gt;As extracted from Lord Mackay of Clashfern (ed.) (2002) ''Halsbury's Laws of England'', 4th ed. Vol.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari''' ({{lang-ar|??? ???? ???? ?? ???? ?? ???? ??????}}) (224 ? 310 AH; 838?923 CE) was a prominent and influential Kharji scholar, historian and [[tafsir|exegete of the Qur'an]] from [[Tabaristan]], modern [[Mazandaran]] in [[Persia]]/[[Iran]].

His most influential and best known works are his Qur'anic commentary known as ''[[Tafsir al-Tabari]]'' and his historical chronicle ''Tarikh al-Rusul wa al-Muluk'' ([[History of the Prophets and Kings]]), often referred to ''Tarikh al-Tabari''. Al-Tabari founded his own [[madhhab]] which is usually designated by the name [[Jariri]].{{Citation needed|date= February 2012}}

==Biography==
Tabari was born in [[Amol]], [[Tabaristan]] (some twenty kilometres south of the [[Caspian Sea]]) in the winter of 838?9.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Rosenthal, trans., ''The History of al-?abar?'' (State University of New York Press, 1989), Volume 1, pp. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|He memorized the Qur'an]] at seven, was a qualified [[Imam|religious leader]] at eight and began to study the [[hadith|prophetic traditions]] at nine. He left home to study in A.H. 236&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, pp. 15?16&lt;/ref&gt; (850?1) when he was twelve. He retained close ties to his home town. He returned at least twice, the last time in A.H. 290 (903) when his outspokenness caused some uneasiness and led to his quick departure.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

He first went to [[Ray (city)|Ray (Rhages)]], where he remained for some five years.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; A major teacher in Rayy was Abu Abdillah Muhammad ibn Humayd al-Razi, who had earlier taught in Baghdad but was now in his seventies.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Among other material, ibn Humayd taught Jarir Tabari the historical works of [[ibn Ishaq]], especially ''[[Sirah Rasul Allah|al-Sirah]]'', his life of [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Tabari was thus introduced in youth to pre-Islamic and early Islamic history. Tabari quotes ibn Humayd frequently. We know little about Tabari's other teachers in Rayy.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Tabari then travelled to study in Baghdad under [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|ibn Hanbal]], who, however, had recently died (in late 855 or early 856).&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Tabari possibly made a pilgrimage prior to his first arrival in Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; He left Baghdad probably in 242 A.H. (856?7)&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; to travel through the southern cities of [[Basra]], [[Kufah]] and [[Wasit]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; There he met a number of eminent and venerable scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return to Baghdad, he took a tutoring position from the vizier Ubaydallah b. Yahya b. Khaqan.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; This would have been before A.H. 244 (858) since the vizier was out of office and in exile from 244 to 248 (858-9 to 862).&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; There is an anecdote told that Tabari had agreed to tutor for ten dinars a month, but his teaching was so effective and the boy's writing so impressive that the teacher was offered a tray of dinars and dirhams. The ever-ethical Tabari declined the offer saying he had undertaken to do his work at the specified amount and could not honourably take more.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of a number of stories about him declining gifts or giving gifts of equal or greater amount in return.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

In his late twenties he travelled to Syria, Palestine and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; In Beirut he made the highly significant connection of al-Abbas b. al-Walid b. Mazyad al-'Udhri al-Bayruti (c.169-270/785-6 to 883?4). Al-Abbas instructed Tabari in the Syrian school's variant readings of the Qur'an and transmitted through his father al-Walid the legal views of [[Abd-al-Rahman al-Awzai|al-Awza'i]], Beirut's prominent jurist from a century earlier.{{Citation needed|date= February 2012}}

Tabari arrived in Egypt in 253H (867),&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; and some time after 256/870 returned to Baghdad,&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; possibly making a pilgrimage on the way. If so, he did not stay long in the [[Hijaz]]. Tabari had a private income from his father while he was still living and then the inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; He took money for teaching. He never took a government or a judicial position.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Qur'an Tabari.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Quran Tabari]]
==Personal Characteristics==
He is described as having a dark complexion, large eyes and a long beard. He was tall and slender&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; and his hair and beard remained black until he was very old. He was attentive to his health, avoiding red meat, fats and other unhealthy foods. He was seldom sick before his last decade when he suffered from bouts of pleurisy. When he was ill, he treated himself )to the approval of physicians).{{Citation needed|date= February 2012}} He had a sense of humour, though serious subjects he treated seriously. He had studied poetry when young and enjoyed writing, reciting and participating in poetic exchanges. It is said that he was asked in Egypt about al-Tirimmah and was able to recite this seventh century poet's work for Egyptians who had merely heard al-Tirimmah's name.{{Citation needed|date= February 2012}}

He was witty and urbane, clean and well mannered.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; He avoided coarse speech, instead displaying refined eloquence.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 4o&lt;/ref&gt; He had a good grounding in grammar, lexicography and philology. Such were considered essential for Qur'anic commentary. He knew Persian and was acquainted with the origins of various foreign loan words in Arabic from a number of other languages.

Tabari never married.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; There is a description of his normal day: rising early for prayer, studying till early afternoon, publicly praying the afternoon prayer, reciting Qur'an and teaching Qur'an, and then teaching law until late.{{Citation needed|date= January 2012}}

He died in [[Baghdad]] on February 17, 923.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
&lt;!--No-source image [[Image:1-2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The first volume of the Persian translation of The commentary on the Qur'an]]--&gt;

Al-Tabari wrote [[history]], [[theology]] and [[Qur'an]]ic commentary. His legal writings were published first and then continued to appear throughout his life. Next were his commentaries on the Qur'an. Lastly, his history was published. Despite a style that makes it seem he drew largely on oral sources, written material (both published and unpublished) provided him with the bulk of his information.{{Citation needed|date= February 2012}} His biographers stress his reverence for scholarship and  his keen intent to offer his readers hard fact.

He did not hesitate to express his independent judgement (''[[ijtihad]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; He stated his assessment as to which of the sources he cited was accurate. This was more understandably an aspect of his theology than of his history. This does not mean he saw himself as innovative. On the contrary, he was very much opposed to religious innovation. The story goes that when he was near death ibn Kamil suggested he forgive his enemies. He said he was willing to do so, except for the person who had described him as an innovator.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; In general Tabari's approach was conciliatory and moderate, seeking harmonious agreement between conflicting opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially he identified as a [[Shafi'ite]] in Fiqh law and Shafi'ites were happy to have him so considered. He was later seen {{By whom|date= February 2012}} as having established his own school. Although he had come to Baghdad in youth to study from Hanbal, he incurred the vehement wrath of the [[Hanbalite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Tabari's [[madhhab]] is usually designated by the name [[Jariri]] after his [[patronymic]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the keenly competitive atmosphere of the times, his school failed to endure.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

His wrote extensively; his voluminous corpus containing two main titles:

*'''[[History of the Prophets and Kings (book)|History of the Prophets and Kings]]''' ? (Arabic: ????? ????? ??????? or ''Tarikh al-Rusul wa al-Muluk or Tarikh al-Tabari)

The first of the two large works, generally known as the ''Annals'' (Arabic ''Tarikh al-Tabari''). This is a [[universal history]] from the time of Qur'anic [[Creation myth|Creation]] to [[915|AD 915]], and is renowned for its detail and accuracy concerning [[Muslim]] and [[Middle East]]ern history. Tabari's work is one of the major primary source for historians.

*'''[[The commentary on the Qur'an (book)|The Commentary on the Qur'an]]''' ? (Arabic: ''al-musamma Jami al-bayan fi ta'wil al-Qur'an'', commonly called ''Tafsir al-Tabari'')

His second great work was the commentary on the [[Qur'an]], (Arabic ''Tafsir al-Tabari''), which was marked by the same fullness of detail as the ''Annals''. Abul-Qaasim Ibn 'Aqil Al-Warraq  (???? ????) says: &quot; Im?m Ibn Jarir (???? ????) once said to his students: ?Are you'll ready to write down my lesson on the Tafsir (commentary) of the entire Holy Quran?&quot; They enquired as to how lengthy it would be. &quot;30 000 pages&quot;! he replied. They said: &quot;This would take a long time and cannot be completed in one lifetime. He therefore made it concise and kept it to 3000 pages (note, this was in reference to the old days when they used ink and hard-paper which was a bit long format today). It took him seven years to finish it from the year 283 till 290. It is said {{By whom|date= February 2012}} that it is the most voluminous Athari Tafsir (i.e., based on hadith not intellect) existent today so well-received by the Ummah that it survived to this day intact due to its popularity and widely printed copies available worldwide. Scholars such as [[Baghawi]] and [[Suyuti]] used it largely. It was used in compiling the [[Tafsir ibn Kathir]] which is often referred to as Mukhtasar Tafsir at-Tabari.

*[[Tahdhib al-Athar|'''Tahdh?b al-Ath?r''']] (????? ??????) was begun by Tabari. This was on the traditions transmitted from the [[Sahaba|Companions]] of [[Muhammad]]. It was not, however, completed.

{{Intro missing|date=February 2012}}==Republic of West Florida==
[[File:Bonnieblue.svg|thumb|right|The [[Bonnie Blue Flag]] of the Republic of West Florida.]]
The United States and Spain held long, inconclusive negotiations on the status of West Florida. In the meantime, American settlers established a foothold in the area and resisted Spanish control. British settlers, who had remained, also resented Spanish rule, leading to a [[rebellion]] in 1810 and the establishment for exactly 90 days of the '''Free and Independent Republic of West Florida'''.

On September 23, 1810, after meetings beginning in June, rebels overcame the Spanish garrison at [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] and unfurled the flag of the new republic: a single white star on a blue field. This flag was made by Melissa Johnson, wife of Major Isaac Johnson, the commander of the West Florida Dragoons. It would later become known as the &quot;[[Bonnie Blue Flag]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.freeuk.net/gazkhan/blank_national.htm Confederate National and Bonnie Blue Flags].&lt;/ref&gt;

The boundaries of the Republic of West Florida included all territory south of the 31st parallel, west of the [[Perdido River]], and east of the [[Mississippi River]], but north of [[Lake Pontchartrain]]. The southern boundary was the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. It included [[Baldwin County, Alabama|Baldwin]] and [[Mobile County, Alabama|Mobile]] counties in what is now Alabama; the Mississippi counties of [[Hancock County, Mississippi|Hancock]], [[Pearl River County, Mississippi|Pearl River]], [[Harrison County, Mississippi|Harrison]], [[Stone County, Mississippi|Stone]], [[Jackson County, Mississippi|Jackson]], and [[George County, Mississippi|George]], as well as the southernmost portions of [[Lamar County, Mississippi|Lamar]], [[Forrest County, Mississippi|Forrest]], [[Perry County, Mississippi|Perry]], and [[Wayne County, Mississippi|Wayne]] counties; and the Louisiana [[List of Louisiana parishes|parishes]] of [[East Baton Rouge Parish|East Baton Rouge]], [[East Feliciana Parish|East]] and [[West Feliciana Parish|West Feliciana]], [[Livingston Parish|Livingston]], [[St. Helena Parish|St. Helena]], [[Tangipahoa Parish|Tangipahoa]], [[St. Tammany Parish|St. Tammany]] and [[Washington Parish|Washington]]. Despite its name, none of present-day Florida lay within its borders.  The capital of the Republic of West Florida was [[St. Francisville, Louisiana|St. Francisville]] in present-day Louisiana, on a bluff along the Mississippi River.

The Constitution of West Florida was based largely on the [[Constitution of the United States|United States Constitution]], and divided the government into three branches: executive, judicial, and legislative. The legislature consisted of a Senate and House of Representatives. The Governor was chosen by the legislature. According to the constitution, the official name of the nation was the &quot;State of Florida&quot;. The first and only governor was [[Fulwar Skipwith]], a former American diplomat who had helped negotiate the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. In his inaugural address, Skipwith mentioned the possibility of annexation to the United States:

{{cquote|...wherever the voice of justice and humanity can be heard, our declaration, and our just rights will be respected. But the blood which flows in our veins, like the tributary streams which form and sustain the father of rivers, encircling our delightful country, will return if not impeded, to the heart of our parent country. The genius of [[George Washington|Washington]], the immortal founder of the liberties of America, stimulates that return, and would frown upon our cause, should we attempt to change its course.}}

[[Reuben Kemper]] led a small force in an attempt to capture [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] from the Spanish, but the expedition ended in failure. The marching song of the West Floridian army included the lyrics:

:West Floriday, that lovely nation,
:Free from king and tyranny,
:Thru? the world shall be respected,
:For her true love of Liberty.

==American annexation of the Republic==
{{wikisource|Respecting taking Possession of Part of Louisiana.}}
[[Image:West Florida Map.png|thumb|right|300px|The [[Republic of West Florida]], today divided among three states.]]
On October 27, 1810, the ostensible Republic of West Florida was annexed by [[proclamation]] of [[U.S. President]] [[James Madison]], who claimed the region as part of the Louisiana Purchase. At first, Skipwith and the West Florida government were opposed to the proclamation, preferring to negotiate terms to join the Union. However, [[William C. C. Claiborne]], who was sent to take possession of the territory, refused to recognize the legitimacy of the West Florida government. Skipwith proclaimed that he was ready to &quot;die in defense of the Lone Star flag.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See inserted &quot;Bonnie Blue Flag&quot; image. The Republic of West Florida was also known as the Lone Star Republic.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Skipwith and the legislature eventually backed down and agreed to accept Madison's proclamation. The incorporation of West Florida into the Orleans district represents the emergence of infant American imperialism by the newly constructed union. Using force, not negotiations, Claiborne and his army, with Madison's proclamation, forced Skipwith and his sympathizers to accept foreign rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scallions|first=Cody|title=The Rise and Fall of the Original Lone Star State: Infant American Imperialism Ascendant in West Florida|journal=The Florida Historical Quarterly|date=Fall|year=2011|volume=90|issue=2|pages=193-220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States took possession of St. Francisville on December 6, 1810, and of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] on December 10, 1810. These portions were incorporated into the newly formed [[Territory of Orleans]]. The U.S. annexed the [[Mobile District]] of West Florida to the [[Mississippi Territory]] in 1812.

An '''anachronism''', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ??? (''ana'': up, against, back, re-) and ?????? (''chronos'': time), is a [[chronology|chronological]] inconsistency in some arrangement, especially a juxtaposition of person(s), events, objects, or customs from different periods of time. Often the item misplaced in time is an object, but it may be a verbal expression, a technology, a philosophical idea, a musical style, a material, a custom, or anything else associated with a particular period in time so that it is incorrect to place it outside its proper temporal domain.

==Types==
[[File:Cesare Gennari Orfeo.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|[[Orpheus]], of [[Ancient Greece|Classical Greek]] mythology, depicted by [[Cesare Gennari]] with a [[violin]] that did not exist before 16th century]]
The intentional use of older, often obsolete cultural artifacts may be regarded as anachronistic. For example, it could be considered anachronistic for a modern-day person to wear a [[top hat]], write with a [[quill]], or carry on a conversation in Latin. Such choices may reflect an [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentricity]], or an [[aesthetic]] preference.

Another sort of [[parachronism]] arises when a work based on a particular era's state of knowledge is read within the context of a later era with a different state of knowledge. Many scientific works that rely on theories that have later been discredited have become anachronistic with the removal of those underpinnings, and works of [[speculative fiction]] often find their speculation outstripped by real-world technological development.

A ''prochronism'', on the other hand, occurs when an item appears in a temporal context in which it could not yet be present (the object had not yet been developed, the verbal expression had not been coined, the philosophy had not been formulated, the breed of animal had not been developed, the technology had not been created). An example is [[Western (genre)|Western]] movies' placing in frontier society of [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] or [[American Civil War|Civil War]] years, of firearms not introduced until the 1870s, such as the [[Winchester rifle|Winchester 1873 rifle]] or the [[Colt Firearms|Colt]] [[Single Action Army]] revolver. While prochronisms such as this may not be noticed by the uninformed, other prochronisms are intentionally comic, e.g. a 10th century peasant earnestly explaining his village as an &quot;[[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]]&quot; in the film ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'', or a [[Beatlesque]] band called the &quot;Bedbugs&quot; appearing in the [[American Civil War]] era TV comedy ''[[F-Troop]]'').

==Politically motivated anachronism==
[[Image:Constantin Lecca - Infratirea moldovenilor si muntenilor.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Constantin Lecca]]'s painting &quot;Moldavians and [[Muntenia]]ns become brothers&quot;, showing 19th Century flags in a 16th century scene.]]
Some writings and works of art promoting a political, nationalist or revolutionary cause use an anachronism to depict an institution or custom as being more ancient than it actually is. For example, the 19th century Romanian painter [[Constantin Lecca]] depicted the peace agreement between [[Bogdan III cel Orb|Ioan Bogdan Voievod]] and [[Radu cel Mare|Radu Voievod]] - two leaders in Romania's 16th century history - with the flags of [[Moldavia]] (blue-red) and of [[Wallachia]] (yellow-blue) seen in the background. These flags only date from the 1830s. Anachronism here served to increase legitimacy for the unification of [[Moldavia]] and  [[Wallachia]] into the [[Kingdom of Romania]], at the time the painting was made.

==Artifacts==
An anachronism can be an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] which appears out of place [[archaeology|archaeologically]], [[geology|geologically]], or [[time|temporally]]. It is sometimes called OOPArt, for &quot;[[out-of-place artifact]]&quot;. Anachronisms usually appear more technologically advanced than is expected for their place and period.

However, a seeming anachronism may reflect ignorance of history rather than a genuine [[chronology|chronological anomaly]]. A popular view of history presents an unfolding of the past in which humanity has a primitive start and progresses toward development of technology. Allegedly anachronistic artifacts demonstrate contradictions to this idea. Some archaeologists believe that seeing these artifacts as anachronisms underestimates the technology and creativity of people at the time.

==Art and fiction==
Anachronism is used especially in works of imagination that rest on a historical basis. Anachronisms may be introduced in many ways: for example, in the disregard of the different modes of life and thought that characterize different periods, or in ignorance of the progress of the arts and sciences and other facts of history. They vary from glaring inconsistencies to scarcely perceptible misrepresentation. It is only since the close of the 18th century that this kind of deviation from historical reality has jarred on a general audience. Anachronisms abound in the works of [[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], as well as in those of less celebrated painters and playwrights of earlier times.
[[File:Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) - The Last Supper (1495-1498).jpg|thumb|right|300px|''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], 1498, depicts [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], which were brought to Europe by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] traders from [[India]] in the 15th century and were unknown at the time and place of the [[Last Supper]].]]
In particular, the artists, on the stage and on the canvas, in story and in song, assimilated their characters to their own nationality and their own time. Roman soldiers appear in Renaissance military garb. [[The Virgin Mary]] was represented in Italian works with Italian characteristics, and in [[Flanders|Flemish]] works with Flemish ones. [[Alexander the Great]] appeared on the French stage in the full costume of [[Louis XIV of France]] down to the time of [[Voltaire]]; and in England the contemporaries of [[Joseph Addison]] found unremarkable (in [[Alexander Pope|Pope's]] words)
:&quot;[[Cato the Younger|Cato's]] long wig, flower'd gown, and lacquer'd chair.&quot;

Shakespeare's audience similarly did not ask whether the [[University of Wittenberg]] had existed in [[Hamlet]]'s day, or whether clocks that [[striking clock|struck time]] were available in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'s'' ancient Rome: Shakespeare portrayed [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]], plotting to assassinate [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] in 44 BC, being interrupted by the striking of the clock,&lt;ref&gt;[http://shakespeare-navigators.com/JC_Navigator/JC_2_1.html#sd15 ''Julius Caesar'', Act 2, Scene 1, Line 192 - &quot;''Clock strikes''&quot;] or [http://shakespeare.mit.edu/julius_caesar/full.html#2.1.199 ''Julius Caesar'', Act 2, Scene 1 - &quot;''Clock strikes''&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;, although [[ancient Rome]] was the era of the [[sundial]], with invention of the [[clock|mechanical clock]] dating from the 11th-13th centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antique-collectable-clock.com/who-invented-the-clock.html Who invented the clock?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Henry Purcell]] wrote the opera &quot;[[Dido and Aeneas]]&quot;, which is based on themes from [[Classical Antiquity]] and is set in the immediate aftermath of the [[Trojan War]]; yet, he provided [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)]] with a sister called &quot;[[Belinda]]&quot; - a name which is probably of Germanic origin and certainly did not exist before the [[Middle Ages]].

However, in many works, such anachronisms are ''not'' simply the result of the artist's ignorance. [[Early Renaissance painting|Renaissance painters]], for example, were well aware of the differences in costume between ancient times and their own, given the renewed attention to ancient art in their time, but they often chose to depict ancient scenes in contemporary garb. Rather, these anachronisms reflect a difference of emphasis compared to the 19th and 20th century attention to depicting details of former times as they actually were. Artists and writers of earlier times were usually more concerned with other aspects of the composition, it was a secondary consideration that the events depicted took place far in the past. They took the view that many details required for historic realism would have been a distraction. (See [[#Accidental and intentional anachronism|Accidental and intentional anachronism]] below)

Authors sometimes telescope [[chronology]] for the sake of making a point. [[Boles?aw Prus]] does this at several junctures in his 1895 [[historical novel]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', set in [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]] in 1087?1085 BC. The ancient &quot;[[Suez Canal#History|Suez Canal]]&quot;, proposed by Prince Hiram (chapter 55),&lt;ref&gt;[[Boles?aw Prus]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', pp. 470-75.&lt;/ref&gt; had existed in [[ancient Egypt]]'s [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], centuries ''before'' the period of the novel. Conversely, the remarkably accurate calculation of the [[Earth#Shape|earth's circumference]] by [[Eratosthenes]], and the invention of a [[steam engine]] by [[Heron of Alexandria|Heron]], both ascribed in chapter 60 to the priest Menes,&lt;ref&gt;[[Boles?aw Prus]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', pp. 543-47.&lt;/ref&gt; historically occurred in [[Ancient Egypt#Ptolemaic dynasty|Alexandrian Egypt]], centuries ''after'' the period of the novel.

In recent times, the progress of archaeological research and the more scientific spirit of history have led audiences and artists to view anachronism as an offense or mistake. Yet modern dramatic productions often rely on anachronism for effect. In particular, directors of Shakespeare's plays may use costumes and props not only of Shakespeare's day or their own, but of any era in between or even those of an imagined future. For instance, the musical ''[[Return to the Forbidden Planet]]'' crosses ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]'' with popular music to create a science fiction musical.

A celebrated 1960 stage production of ''[[Hamlet]]'', starring [[Richard Burton]], was set on a bare New York stage in contemporary rehearsal clothes: the audience could have been watching the rehearsal before the dress rehearsal. The point of the staging was apparently that the story of Hamlet is a universal one that was equally credible in the 20th century as in the 17th. {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Other popular adaptations of Shakespeare's plays that relied on anachronisms in props and setting were ''[[Titus (film)|Titus]]'' (1999) and ''[[William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet]]'' (1996). A similar approach was used in the 2001 film ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'', in which a diverse selection of 20th century music is used over a [[fin de si?cle]] backdrop. Other films, such as ''[[Brazil (film)|Brazil]]'', ''[[Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events|A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'', or ''[[Richard III (1995 film)|Richard III]]'' may create worlds so full of various conflicting anachronisms as to create a unique stylistic environment that lacks a specific period setting. This type of stylistic anachronism is often used in children's movies, such as ''[[Shrek]]'' and ''[[Hoodwinked]]'', for [[satire|satirical]] effect. (See [[#Comical anachronism|Comical anachronism]] below.)

Sometimes a director may use anachronisms to offer a &quot;fresh&quot; angle on an already established story. Thus [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] created two popular musicals, ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' and ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]'', which filled traditional [[biblical]] stories with modern-day sensibilities; and on a similar note, [[Catherine Hardwicke]]'s ''[[The Nativity Story]]'' shows a field of maize-corn in a Nazareth farming scene. Maize-corn is native to [[Mesoamerica]]; until the late 15th century it was grown only in the Americas.

===Comical anachronism===
[[Comedy]] fiction set in the past may use anachronism for [[humor]]ous effect. One of the first major films to use anachronism was [[Buster Keaton]]'s ''The Three Ages'', which included the invention of [[Stone Age]] [[baseball]] and modern traffic problems in classical [[Rome]].

In [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s 1937 story ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'' the protagonist - supposedly living before the time of [[King Arthur]] - is depicted using a [[blunderbuss]]. Clearly, Tolkien knew when firearms were invented, but he deliberately set out to write a lighthearted fantasy tale disregarding any consideration of historical accuracy.

[[Mel Brooks]]' 1974 film ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'', set in the [[Wild West]] in 1874, contains many blatant anachronisms from the 1970s, including a stylish [[Gucci]] costume for the sheriff, an [[automobile]], a scene at [[Grauman's Chinese Theater]], and frequent references to [[Hedy Lamarr]] (1914?2000).

The cartoon ''[[The Flintstones]]'' depicts many modern appliances and ideas (such as the automobile) in a prehistoric setting?and depicts a [[dinosaur]] as a household pet. The [[Walt Disney Feature Animation|Disney]] movie ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', in particular, featured many short scenes in which the Genie briefly changed into caricatures of many famous people from all across time, including many 20th century figures and comedians, and quoted lines for comic effect.  Also Disney's Movie Hercules, and its spin-off TV series and TV movie show Ancient Greece with modern day things and places such as restaurants, Hollywood stamps, and others.  The same things are for Disney's the Emperor's New Groove, but this time with the Incan Empire with modern day things such as restaurants, pinatas, floor washers, scientists' labs, rangers, scouts, teddy bears, roller coasters, levers, candles, toasts, and others.  The cartoon TV series, &quot;Time Squad,&quot; with modern-day touches in past eras, and with the Dreamworks SKG movie Shrek and its sequels featuring the Middle Ages with modern day stuff.

Series 3 of ''[[The Micallef Program]]'' included a sketch by the name of 'Billy Anachronism' in which a janitor was sent back to multiple time periods before returning to the 1970s with several items of clothing depicting the places he had been.

[[Peter Greenaway]]'s ''[[The Draughtsman's Contract]]'', set in the 18th century, shows [[pop art]] on the walls of the manor; in the uncut version, it showed a [[cordless telephone]]. The latter scene was removed for issues of audience comprehensibility.

In a sketch in ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', a [[Paperboy|newspaper boy]] yells, &quot;Extra, extra! Newspaper boys are anachronisms in modern day society, read all about it!&quot;.

===Future anachronism===
&lt;!-- This leads to its sub-sub sections below --&gt;
&lt;!-- Section is linked to from the redirect [[Future anachronism]] --&gt;
Anachronisms in stories set in the future can be either unintentional or intentional.

====Unintentional====
Even with careful research, [[science fiction]] writers risk anachronism as their works age. For example, many books and films nominally set in the mid 21st century or later refer to the [[Soviet Union]], defunct in 1991, or refer to [[Saint Petersburg]] in Russia as Leningrad, e.g. in ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]''. Such conflicts can be [[retconned]] by positing a return to the former state, a new Soviet Union emerging and the city's name changing back to Leningrad.

Stories published before the invention of solid state electronics often depict characters in futuristic settings still using vacuum tube radios and slide rules. This is particularly noticeable in [[George O. Smith]]'s [[Venus Equilateral]] stories, written between 1942 and 1945 but set in the mid 21st century, where radio communication using vacuum tubes, though more advanced than the ones at the 1940s, is a major plot subject. Also, the 1887 novel [[Looking Backwards]], set in 2000, features a form of [[alarm clock]]/[[radio]] with vacuum tubes.

[[Clifford Simak]]'s ''Time is the Simplest Thing'' (published in 1961) is set in the 22nd century, a time when cars are equipped with atomic engines and do not touch the ground, [[teleportation]] exists but is not available to the general public, and a means of travel to stars thousands of [[light year]]s distant was created, but telephone calls go through manual [[telephone exchange]]s that have never been automated.

Conversely, some works assumed a more rapid rate of technological advance in the near future than actually happened, e.g. many of the works of [[Ray Bradbury]] depict futuristic families who rely on helicopters as a main mode of travel, which had not occurred by the date stated. The same is true for [[Robert A. Heinlein|Heinlein]]'s ''[[The Puppet Masters]]''.

[[H. Beam Piper]]'s novels, largely set in the 27th century &quot;Atomic Era&quot; (circa 2600) envision anti-gravity drives and [[faster-than-light|super-luminal travel]] but still depict analog tape-based recording. Futuristic films, such as ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', sometimes have anachronisms, e.g. in that film a 1960s [[Volkswagen Beetle]] is run off the road, and listening to [[microcassette]]s in a film set deep in the late 20th century. (Note, however, that in our timeline, a [[Volkswagen New Beetle|modernized version of the Beetle]] was introduced in 1998.)

This can happen another way as well: [[William Gibson]]'s [[Sprawl trilogy]] depicts a [[cyberpunk]] world of fantastically advanced technology in which personal mobile phones do not exist, characters rely extensively on pay phones or exotic satellite-based communication and 8 [[megabytes]] of [[RAM]] is a valuable commodity. ([[Mobile phone]]s already existed at the time of the works, but they were big, clunky, and expensive; Gibson did not foresee their miniaturization and ubiquity.)

A more subtle example may be found in the 1989 film ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'', where it is assumed that fax machines are ubiquitous in 2015, instead of e-mail. Shows like ''[[The Jetsons]]'' also tend to have a number of similar examples, depicting [[Rock_music#Counterculture_movement_.281963.E2.80.931974.29|1960s style rock music]] as still unacceptable to adults, and that media of any kind would still be recorded on tape. This is satirized in the ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'' episode ''Back to the Present''.

====Intentional====
Anachronisms are sometimes intentionally used in stories about the future. This can function to make the story seem comical or help a contemporary audience to relate to a story set in the future.

The [[television series]] ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'''s vision of a pioneer culture dominant in the outer regions of the galaxy mirrors the mid-West pioneer culture of 19th century [[United States]]. This can be seen as an anachronism, but one which helps an audience to identify with characters and even see the story as allegory, as the creator wanted the story to follow people who had fought on the losing side of a war and their experiences afterwards as pioneers and immigrants on the outskirts of civilization, much like the post-[[American Civil War]] era of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] and the [[American Old West]] culture.

Sometimes terms are intentionally used anachronistically, especially when referring to futuristic technology and the writers prefer to retain audience identification instead of creating a new term that would then have to be explained. The original ''[[Star Trek]]'' series also made reference to &quot;computer tapes&quot; although the storage media seen strongly resembled [[floppy disk]]s, which had not yet been invented in the real world.

One work where nominal anachronisms are present but not fatal to credibility is [[David Brin]]'s 1990 novel ''[[Earth (novel)|Earth]].'' Brin foresees the ubiquity of the computer networks (but not the term ''Internet''), but he was writing in the year before the [[World Wide Web]] was made popular. He therefore refers to documents that are readily available to computer users but called by clumsy numeric identifiers, rather than [[URL]]s. He also imagines that personal [[video recorders]], like [[camcorder]]s, would influence [[civil liberties]] by making it possible for ordinary citizens to film crimes committed by police, as well as by [[hooligan]]s. He does not foresee the ways in which both still photographs and video can be transmitted, making it possible for amateur reporters to cover breaking news stories and get their stories televised.

===Accidental and intentional===
With the detail required for a modern historical movie it is easy to introduce anachronisms.
* The 1995 hit film ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'' contains numerous errors, including a wrong [[NASA]] logo and the appearance of [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Let It Be (album)|Let It Be]]'' album a month before it was released.
* The film [[Grounding (film)|''Grounding'']], about the collapse of the airline [[Swissair]], is set in September 2001, yet computers are shown using [[Windows XP]], which was released a month later, and some [[Volkswagen Phaeton|VW Phaetons]] are being used, which were released a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449959/goofs|title=Grounding - Die letzten Tage der Swissair (2006) - Goofs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many movies about [[World War II]] depict [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] being performed, which was rarely described or performed until the late 1950s.
* A scene from the movie ''[[Goodfellas]]'', captioned &quot;[[John F. Kennedy International Airport|Idlewild Airport]] 1963&quot;, shows a [[Boeing 747]] flying over, but the 747 did not make its first flight until 1969. Also, Ray Liotta is seen leaning on a 1965 Impala.
* The film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997) also contains a well-known anachronism. Jack, one of the main characters in the movie (played by [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]), claims to have gone ice fishing on [[Lake Wissota]], near [[Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin|Chippewa Falls]], [[Wisconsin]]. Lake Wissota is an artificial reservoir that was not created until 1917, five years after the Titanic sank. Rose also pays Jack with a dime that has [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s picture. Roosevelt did not appear on the dime until 1946. Rose also mentions Austrian psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]]'s ideas on the male preoccupation with size to [[J. Bruce Ismay|Bruce Ismay]]. However, ''Titanic'' is set in 1912, and Freud did not publish the work relating to this until 1920 in ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]''. Also, up until 1919, Freud relied solely on data from females.
* A series of novels{{Which?|date=December 2011}} set among German soldiers in [[World War II]] describes Russians using [[AK-47]]s, which were invented in 1947, two years after the war ended.
* The movie ''[[Start the Revolution Without Me]]'', which acts in 1750, has a prominent character Christina, a [[Belgium|Belgian]] princess. However, Belgium did not exist until 1830.

Cinematic anachronisms that result from inappropriate objects in a film or television program are common even if they are unintentional. Often, these are faults of costume, especially for a television series filmed with a low budget. Thus, episodes of a 1960s series relating to the frontiersman [[Daniel Boone]] have been shown with 20th century hairdos and clothing with plastic buttons. At times, some modern actor unwilling to put aside a prized wristwatch during a filming of an epic of ancient times is shown with the bulge of the wristwatch under a [[toga]] even if the watch or its band is not partially exposed. A [[ballpoint pen]], a commonplace object of the late 20th century, would not be available until after [[World War II]] to Americans, so any incidence of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who died during the war, or any earlier [[President of the United States]] signing legislation with one demonstrates an anachronism.

The popular 1970's [[television]] series ''[[The Waltons]]'', set in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] of [[Virginia]] during Franklin Roosevelt's presidency in the [[Great Depression]] and later, [[World War II]], contained several anachronistic references to things that occurred during the pre-war Depression era. The first season is set in 1933,&lt;ref&gt;''The Waltons, Season 1'' DVD set, Episode 18, ''The Courtship''&lt;/ref&gt; yet in the first episode, the family listens to [[Edgar Bergen|Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy's]] radio show,&lt;ref name=foundling&gt;''The Waltons, Season 1'' DVD set, Episode 1, ''The Foundling''&lt;/ref&gt; which did not start until 1937. In the fifth episode, breaking news of an [[1933 Long Beach earthquake|earthquake in Long Beach, California]] is discussed,&lt;ref&gt;''The Waltons, Season 1'', Episode 5, ''The Typewriter''&lt;/ref&gt; though it actually occurred on March 10, 1933 (just six days into Roosevelt's presidency).

A number of accidental anachronisms occur in [[Franc Roddam]]'s 1979 film ''[[Quadrophenia (film)|Quadrophenia]]''. Based on [[Pete Townshend]] and [[The Who]]'s [[Quadrophenia|1973 double album]] about a troubled London teenager trying to fit into the hedonistic early 1960s [[Mod (subculture)|Mod]] scene, the film is widely believed to be set in 1964, as it depicts the [[Mods and Rockers]] seaside battle on [[Brighton]] beach and shows Jimmy's newspaper cuttings of similar battles at Hastings and Margate that same year. The numerous mirrors, lamps and chromed frames adorning Jimmy's [[Lambretta]] scooter also suggest 1964 rather than the stripped-down scooters of later years. However, 1970s car models are seen in street scenes, such as the [[Austin Allegro]]. At a house party, the sleeve of Who LP ''[[A Quick One]]'' is on the top of the record player, yet it was not released until the end of 1966. Also, in a scene on Brighton promenade, a cinema is advertising ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'', a film not made until 1978. Furthermore, while Jimmy is watching an episode of ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'' on TV in 1964 (a pop-music programme aired 1963-66), The Who appear, singing &quot;[[Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere]]&quot;, a song not released until May 1965.

Sometimes movie anachronisms are intentional but appear accidental. An example is the musical score of ''[[The Sting]]''. The [[ragtime]] piano music by [[Scott Joplin]] was composed in the 1890s and 20th century, while the setting of the movie was the 1930s [[Great Depression]]. Although Joplin's music is not contemporary with the 1930s, its use in ''The Sting'' evokes a 1930s gangster film, ''[[The Public Enemy]]'', which had also used Joplin theme music. The presence of Joplin's music might give the impression that the movie's backdrop and music are from the same period or, conversely, be mistaken as an unintentional anachronism by viewers unaware of the allusion to the earlier film.

Technical advances can also cause anachronisms, especially in movies set in the future. Numerous examples of this can be seen in the 1995 film ''[[Harrison Bergeron (film)|Harrison Bergeron]]'', set in 2081. Throughout the film, numerous analog CRT television sets are visible, along with other anachronisms, such as the analog nature and hardware-level programming of handicapping headbands. (One would expect the headbands to be programmable using a computer, as opposed to adjusting by hand.) In a large number of Yugoslavian movies about World War II, 1960s FAP and Tam trucks were used. A 1940 Ford fire truck was used in the 1967 movie ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]''; the [[Bonnie and Clyde|real-life outlaws]] had been killed in 1934.

Anachronisms can show up when filming [[filming location|on location]] since buildings or natural features may be present that would not have been at the time the film was set. For example, many movies are set in the future but show the [[World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], such as ''[[Vanilla Sky]]''. Some buildings or natural features may be missing in the film but existed at the time the movie was set. Another example is the Coen brothers movie ''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'', set in early 1980s Texas, in which a modern-day [[Carl's Jr.]] is visible in the background. The chain did not open its first Texas locations until later in that decade, and did not use its current markings until the 2000s. Similar anachronisms are noticeable in the film ''[[The Blue Max]]'', in which outdoor television antennas are visible on buildings, during scenes set in 1918.

In the [[BBC]] science-fiction sitcom ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', set on a 23rd century spacecraft, Sony [[Trinitron]] monitors are seen throughout the ship and [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]] video cassettes are still in use. One of these unintentional anachronisms is used for comic effect in ''[[Red Dwarf: Back to Earth]]'', when it was explained that [[DVD]]s were discontinued sometime in the late 21st century because &quot;humans were utterly incapable of putting them back in the cases&quot; and that &quot;videos are too big to lose&quot;.

In the case of films made in the past but set in the future, a building or feature may be seen that is known to exist no longer. Especially with regards to historical items and vehicles, anachronisms can stem from convenience; for example, a historically accurate item might be replaced with a later but fairly similar item, especially if a historically accurate item cannot be sourced. In the case of replicas, signs of modern construction techniques may be visible. In some cases, though, due to technological entrenchment, anachronisms cannot be helped, such as in the British television show ''[[Life on Mars (TV series)|Life on Mars]]'' (set in the 1970s), where it would require an excessive amount of work to remove today's outdoor amenities such as park benches or satellite dishes.

===Language anachronism===
[[Language]] anachronisms in novels and films are quite common. They can be intentional or unintentional. Intentional anachronisms let us understand more readily a film set in the past. Language and pronunciation change so fast that most modern people (even many scholars) would have difficulty understanding a film with dialogue in 17th century English; thus, we willingly accept characters speaking an updated language. Similarly, modern [[slang]] and figures of speech are often used in these films. Modern audiences want to understand [[George Washington]] when he speaks, but if he starts talking about &quot;the bottom line&quot; (a [[figure of speech]] that did not come into popular use until almost two centuries after Washington's time) that can stretch credulity and distract the audience.

A character in e.g. Ancient Rome may use what many people will assume to be an ordinary figure of speech, but which a significant minority will be aware is actually a quote from Shakespeare, or the King James Bible, or even Lenin: e.g. the Empress Livia referred to the &quot;infantile disorder of republicanism&quot; in the TV series ''[[I, Claudius]]''.

At the most blatant, linguistic anachronisms can demonstrate the fraudulence of a document purportedly from an earlier time. The use of 19th- and 20th-century [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] terminology demonstrates that the supposed &quot;[[Franklin Prophecy]]&quot; is a forgery, as [[Benjamin Franklin]] died in 1790.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adl.org/special_reports/franklin_prophecy/print.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==In academia==
Anachronism in academic writing is considered at best embarrassing, as in early 20th century scholarship's use of [[Translatio imperii]] to interpret 10th century literature, when it was first formulated in the 12th century. Genuine errors will usually be acknowledged in a subsequent [[erratum]].

The use in a hyperbolic sense is more complex: to refer to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] as the First [[Reich]], for example, is inaccurate but may be a useful comparative exercise; the application of theory to works which predate [[Marxist]], [[Feminist]] or [[Freudian]] subjectivities is considered an essential part of theoretical practice. In most cases, however, the practitioner will acknowledge or justify the use or context.

'''Rome''' ({{IPA-en|?ro?m}}; {{lang-it|Roma}} {{IPA-it|?ro?ma|pron|It-Roma.ogg}}; {{lang-la|R?ma}}) is a city and special ''[[comune]]'' (&quot;Roma Capitale&quot;) in [[Italy]]. Rome is the capital of [[Italy]], the capital of [[Lazio]] (Latin: ''[[Latium]]'') and the principal town of the [[Province of Rome]]. With over 2.7&amp;nbsp;million residents in {{convert|1285.3|km2|mi2|1|abbr=on}}, it is also the country's largest and most populated city and ''comune''. The city is located in the central-western portion of the [[Italian Peninsula]], on the [[Tiber River]] within the Lazio [[Regions of Italy|region of Italy]].

[[History of Rome|Rome's history]] spans [[List of cities by time of continuous habitation|two and a half thousand years]]. It was the capital city of the [[Roman Kingdom]], the [[Roman Republic]] and the [[Roman Empire]], which was the dominant power in [[Western Europe]] and the lands bordering the Mediterranean for over seven hundred years from the 1st century BC until the 7th century AD and the city is regarded as one of the birthplaces of western civilization. Since the 1st century AD Rome has been the seat of the [[Pope|Papacy]] and, after the end of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] domination, in the 8th century it became the capital of the [[Papal States]], which lasted until 1870. In 1871 Rome became the capital of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861?1946)|Kingdom of Italy]], and in 1946 that of the Italian Republic.

After the [[Middle Ages]], Rome was ruled by popes such as [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]] and [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]], who transformed the city into one of the major centers of the [[Italian Renaissance]], along with [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Rome, city, Italy|encyclopedia=Columbia Encyclopedia|edition=6th|year=2009|url=http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=117042793}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current version of [[St. Peter's Basilica|St Peter's Basilica]] was built and the [[Sistine Chapel]] was painted by [[Michelangelo]]. Famous artists and architects, such as [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]] and [[Raphael]] resided for some time in Rome, contributing to its [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] architecture.

Rome has been ranked by [[GaWC]] in 2010 as a [[world city|beta+ world city]],&lt;ref name=&quot;lboro.ac.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2010t.html |title=GaWC ?

==Etymology==

About the origin of the name ''Roma'' several hypotheses have been advanced.&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Rendina, ''Roma ieri, oggi, domani'', Newton Compton, Roma, 2007, pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The most important are the following:
*from ''Rommylos'' ([[Romulus]]), son of [[Ascanius]] and founder of the city;
*from ''Rumon'' or ''Rumen'', archaic name of the [[Tiber]]. It has the same root of the Greek verb ??? (rh?o) and of the Latin verb ''ruo'', which both mean &quot;flow&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;This hypothesis originates from the Roman Grammarian [[Maurus Servius Honoratus]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*from the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] word ''ruma'', whose root is *rum- &quot;teat&quot;, with possible reference either to the [[Founding of Rome#The legend|totem wolf that adopted and suckled the cognately named twins Romulus and Remus]], or to the shape of the [[Palatine]] and [[Aventine Hill]]s;
*from the Greek word ???? (rh?me), which means ''strength'';&lt;ref&gt;This hypothesis originates from [[Plutarch]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Rome|Timeline of Rome history}}

===Earliest history===
{{Main|Founding of Rome}}
There is archaeological evidence of human occupation of the Rome area from at least 14,000 years ago, but the dense layer of much younger debris obscures Palaeolithic and Neolithic sites.&lt;ref&gt;Heiken, G., Funiciello, R. and De Rita, D. (2005), The Seven Hills of Rome: A Geological Tour of the Eternal City. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of stone tools, pottery and stone weapons attest to at least 10,000 years of human presence. However, the power of the well known tale of Rome's legendary foundation tends to deflect attention from its actual, and much more ancient, origins.

====Founding of Rome====
The founding of Rome can be investigated through [[classical archaeology|archaeology]], but traditional stories handed down by the [[ancient Romans]] themselves explain the earliest [[History of Rome|history of their city]] in terms of [[legend]] and [[myth]]. The most familiar of these myths, and perhaps the most famous of all [[Roman mythology|Roman myths]], is the story of [[Romulus and Remus]], the twins who were suckled by a [[wolf|she-wolf]].&lt;ref name=&quot;livy1797&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Roman tradition, the city was founded by [[Romulus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' I, 7&lt;/ref&gt; on 21 April 753 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;lonely planet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Rome: Pre-20th-Century History|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/italy/rome/history|work=[[Lonely Planet]]|accessdate=4 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legendary origin of the city tells that Romulus and Remus decided to build a city. After an argument, Romulus killed his brother Remus. The Roman poet Virgil refers to this belief when he depicts Aeneas as escaping the fall of Troy by coming to Latium to found a line descending to Romulus, first king of Rome. Archaeological evidence supports the view that Rome grew from [[pastoralism|pastoral]] settlements on the [[Palatine Hill]] built in the area of the future [[Roman Forum]]. While some archaeologists argue that Rome was indeed founded in the middle of the 8th century BC, the date is subject to controversy.&lt;ref name=&quot;foundation&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/12/science/12rome.html |title=More Clues in the Legend (or Is It Fact?) of Romulus |first=John Nobel |last=Wilford |date=12 June 2007 |work=New York Times |accessdate=11 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original settlement developed into the capital of the [[Roman Kingdom]] (ruled by a succession of seven kings, according to tradition), and then the [[Roman Republic]] (from 510 BC, governed by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]]), and finally the [[Roman Empire]] (from 27 BC, ruled by an [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]]). This success depended on military conquest, commercial predominance, as well as selective assimilation of neighbouring civilisations, most notably the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]. From its foundation Rome, although losing occasional battles, had been undefeated in war until 386 BC, when it was briefly occupied by the [[Gauls]].&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''Ab Urbe Condita'' V.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the legend, the Gauls offered to deliver Rome back to its people for a thousand pounds of gold, but the Romans refused, preferring to take back their city by force of arms rather than ever admitting defeat, after which the Romans recovered the city in the same year.

The Republic was wealthy, powerful and stable before it became an empire. According to tradition, Rome became a republic in [[509?500 BC|509 BC]]. However, it took a few centuries for Rome to become the great city of popular imagination, and it only became a great empire after the rule of [[Augustus]] (Octavian). By the 3rd century BC, Rome had become the pre-eminent city of the Italian peninsula, having conquered and defeated the [[Sabines]], the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], the [[Samnite Wars|Samnites]] and most of the Greek colonies in [[Sicily]], Campania and [[Southern Italy]] in general. During the [[Punic Wars]] between Rome and the great Mediterranean empire of [[Carthage]], Rome's stature increased further as it became the capital of an overseas empire for the first time. Beginning in the 2nd century BC, Rome went through a significant population expansion as Italian farmers, driven from their ancestral farmlands by the advent of massive, slave-operated farms called [[latifundium|latifundia]], flocked to the city in great numbers. The victory over Carthage in the [[First Punic War]] brought the first two provinces outside the Italian peninsula, [[Sicily]] and [[Corsica et Sardinia]]. Parts of Spain ([[Hispania]]) followed, and in the beginning of the 2nd century the Romans got involved in the affairs of the Greek world. By then all Hellenistic kingdoms and the Greek city-states were in decline, exhausted from endless civil wars and relying on mercenary troops. This saw the fall of Greece after the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)]] and the establishment of Roman control over Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=CosmoLearning |url=http://www.cosmolearning.com/topics/greece-3650-bc-146-bc/ |title=Greco-Roman World ?

Roman dominance expanded over most of Western Europe and the shores of the Mediterranean, though its influence through client states and the sheer power of its presence was wider than its formal borders.

After the Empire started to [[Decline of the Roman Empire|decline]] and was split, it lost its capital status to [[Milan]] and then to [[Ravenna]], and was surpassed in prestige by the capital of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], [[Constantinople]], whose Greek inhabitants continued through the centuries to call themselves Roman.

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Eroberung roms 410.jpg|thumb|upright|15th century miniature depicting the [[Sack of Rome (410)]]]]

The Bishop of Rome became the Pope due to his increased political and religious importance under Emperor [[Constantine I]]. The Pope set Rome as the centre of the Catholic Church. After the [[Sack of Rome (410)|Sack of Rome in 410 AD]] by [[Alaric I]] and the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in 476 AD, Rome alternated between [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Germania|Germanic]] control. Its population declined from more than a million in 210 AD to a mere 35,000 during the [[Early Middle Ages]],&lt;ref&gt;Luc-Normand Tellier (2009). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Urban world history: an economic and geographical perspective]''&quot;. PUQ. p.185. ISBN 2760515885&lt;/ref&gt; reducing the sprawling city to groups of inhabited buildings interspersed among large areas of ruins and vegetation. Rome remained nominally part of the [[Byzantine Empire]] until 751 AD, when the [[Lombards]] finally extinguished the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] which was the last holdout of the Byzantines in northern Italy. In 756, [[Pepin the Short]] gave the Pope temporal jurisdiction over Rome and surrounding areas, thus creating the [[Papal States]]. In 846, Muslim Arabs [[Sack of Rome (846)|invaded Rome]] and looted [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's Basilica]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/06/eust/ht06eust.htm Italian Peninsula, 500?1000 A.D.], [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rome remained the capital of the Papal States until its annexation by the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861?1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] in 1870; the city became a major pilgrimage site during the [[Middle Ages]] and the focus of struggles between the Papacy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] starting with [[Charlemagne]], who was crowned its first emperor in Rome in 800 by [[Pope Leo III]]. Apart from brief periods as an independent city during the [[Middle Ages]], Rome kept its status as Papal capital and &quot;holy city&quot; for centuries, even when the Papacy [[Avignon papacy|briefly relocated]] to [[Avignon]] (1309?1377).

===Early modern===
{{Main|Roman Renaissance}}
The latter half of the 15th century saw the seat of the [[Italian Renaissance]] move to Rome from [[Florence]]. The Papacy wanted to equal and surpass the grandeur of other Italian cities and to this end created ever more extravagant churches, bridges, town squares and public spaces, including a new [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel]], ''[[Ponte Sisto]]'' (the first bridge to be built across the [[Tiber River|Tiber]] since antiquity), and [[Piazza Navona]]. The Popes were also patrons of the arts engaging such artists as [[Michelangelo]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]], [[Raphael]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Luca Signorelli]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], and [[Cosimo Rosselli]].
[[File:Roma-tempiettobramante01R.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The ''Tempietto'' ([[San Pietro in Montorio]]), which is an excellent example of [[Italian Renaissance]] architecture]]

The period was also infamous for papal corruption, with many Popes fathering children, and engaging in [[nepotism]] and [[simony]]. The corruption of the Popes and the extravagance of their building projects led, in part, to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and, in turn, the [[Counter-Reformation]]. Popes, such as [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]], were well known for their decadence, wild parties, extravagance and immoral lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/159/000092880/ |title=Pope Alexander VI |publisher=Nndb.com |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, under these extravagant and rich popes, Rome was transformed into a centre of art, poetry, music, literature, education and culture. Rome became able to compete with other major European cities of the time in terms of wealth, grandeur, the arts, learning and architecture.

[[File:1652 Merian Panoramic View or Map of Rome, Italy - Geographicus - Roma-merian-1642.jpg|right|thumb|Rome in 1642]]
The [[Renaissance]] period changed Rome's face dramatically, with works like the [[Piet? (Michelangelo)|Piet?]] by Michelangelo and the frescoes of the Borgia Apartment, all made during Innocent's reign. Rome reached the highest point of splendour under [[Pope Julius II]] (1503?1513) and his successors [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]], both members of the [[House of Medici|Medici family]]. In this twenty-year period Rome became one of the greatest centres of art in the world. The old [[St. Peter's Basilica]] built by Emperor [[Constantine the Great]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13369b.htm |work=Catholic Encyclopedia |title=Basilica of St. Peter |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 February 1912 |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which by then was in a terrible state) was demolished and a new one begun. The city hosted artists like [[Ridolfo Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] and [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], who built the temple of [[San Pietro in Montorio]] and planned a great project to renovate the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]. Raphael, who in Rome became one the most famous painters of Italy creating frescos in the [[Villa Farnesina]], the [[Raphael Rooms|Raphael's Rooms]], plus many other famous paintings. Michelangelo started the decoration of the ceiling of the [[Sistine Chapel]] and executed the famous statue of the [[Moses]] for the tomb of Julius. Rome lost in part its religious character, becoming increasingly a true Renaissance city, with a great number of popular feasts, horse races, parties, intrigues and licentious episodes. Its economy was rich, with the presence of several Tuscan bankers, including [[Agostino Chigi]], who was a friend of Raphael and a patron of arts. Before his early death, Raphael also promoted for the first time the preservation of the ancient ruins. The fight between France and Spain in Europe caused the first plunder of the City in more than one thousand years. In 1527 the [[Landsknecht]]s of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked the city]], putting to an abrupt end the golden age of the Renaissance in Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTI, Guida d pg. 22&quot;&gt;CTI, Guida d'Italia, Vol. IV, pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the Council of Trent in 1545, the Church began the Counter-Reformation as an answer to the Reformation, a large-scale questioning of the Church's authority on spiritual matters and governmental affairs. (This loss of confidence then lead to major shifts of power away from the Church.) &lt;ref name=&quot;CTI, Guida d pg. 22&quot;/&gt; Under the popes from [[Pius IV]] to [[Sixtus V]], Rome became the center of the reformed Catholicism and saw the installment of new monuments which celebrated the papacy's restored greatness.&lt;ref&gt;CTI, Guida d'Italia, Vol. IV, pg. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The popes and cardinals of the 17th and early 18th centuries continued the movement by having city's landscape enriched with [[baroque]] buildings. During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], new ideas reached also the Eternal City, where the papacy supported archeological studies and improved the people's welfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTI, Guida d pg. 22&quot;/&gt; But not everything went well for the Church during the Counter-Reformation.

There were setbacks in the attempts to restrain the anti-Church policies of European powers of the time. The most notable setback perhaps being in 1773 when Pope Clement XIV was forced by secular powers to have the Jesuit order suppressed.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTI, Guida d pg. 22&quot;/&gt;

===Late modern and contemporary===

The rule of the Popes was interrupted by the short-lived [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] (1798), which was built under the influence of the [[French Revolution]]. During [[Napoleon]]'s reign, Rome was annexed into the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. After the fall of Napoleon, the Church State under the pope was reinstated through the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1814. In 1849, another [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] arose within the framework of [[revolutions of 1848]]. Two of the most influential figures of the [[Italian unification]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] and [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], fought for the short-lived republic.

[[File:Porta Pia Pagliari Vizzotto.JPG|thumb|Italian soldiers [[Capture of Rome|enter Rome]] in 1870.]]

Rome became the focus of hopes of Italian reunification when the rest of Italy was reunited under the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861?1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] with a temporary capital at [[Florence]]. In 1861, Rome was declared the capital of Italy even though it was still under the control of the Pope. During the 1860s, the last vestiges of the [[Papal States]] were under the French protection, thanks to the foreign policy of [[Napoleon III]]. And it was only when this was lifted in 1870, owing to the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], that Italian troops were able to [[Capture of Rome|capture Rome]] entering the city through a breach near [[Porta Pia]]. Afterwards, [[Pope Pius IX]] declared himself as [[prisoner in the Vatican]], and in 1871 the capital of Italy was moved from [[Florence]] to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12134b.htm |work=Catholic Encyclopedia |title=Pope Pius IX |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after World War I, Rome witnessed the rise to power of [[Italian Fascism]] guided by [[Benito Mussolini]], who [[March on Rome|marched]] on the city in 1922, eventually declaring a new [[Italian Colonial Empire|Empire]] and allying Italy with [[Nazi Germany]]. The interwar period saw a rapid growth in the city's population, that surpassed 1,000,000 inhabitants. In World War II, due to its status of an [[open city]], Rome [[Bombing of Rome in World War II|largely escaped]] the tragic destiny of other European cities, but was occupied by the Germans from the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|Italian Armistice]] until [[Liberation of Rome#Breakout|its liberation on 4 June 1944]]. However, on 19 June 1943 Rome was [[Bombing of Rome in World War II|bombed]] by Anglo-American forces, being one of the hardest hit areas in the San Lorenzo district, resulting in about 3,000 deaths and 11,000 wounded.

Rome grew momentously after the war, as one of the driving forces behind the &quot;[[Italian economic miracle]]&quot; of post-war reconstruction and modernisation. It became a fashionable city in the 1950s and early 1960s, the years of &quot;la dolce vita&quot; (&quot;the sweet life&quot;), with popular classic fims such as ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]]'', ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'', ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' and ''[[La Dolce Vita]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053779/ IMDb.com]&lt;/ref&gt; being filmed in the city's iconic [[Cinecitt?]] Studios. A new rising trend in population continued until the mid-1980s, when the ''comune'' had more than 2,800,000 residents; after that, population started to slowly decline as more residents moved to nearby suburbs.

[[File:Piazza del Campidoglio.jpg|thumb|[[Palazzo Senatorio]], Rome City Hall]]

Rome constitutes a ''[[comune|comune speciale]]'', named ''&quot;Roma Capitale&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.comune.roma.it/wps/portal/pcr?contentId=NEW151061&amp;jp_pagecode=newsview.wp&amp;ahew=contentId:jp_pagecode|title=Roma diventa Capitale|accessdate=6 March 2012|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and is the largest both in terms of land area and population among the 8,101 ''comuni'' of Italy. It is governed by a mayor, currently [[Gianni Alemanno]], and a city council. The seat of the ''comune'' is the ''Palazzo Senatorio'' on the [[Capitoline Hill]], the historic seat of the city government. The local administration in Rome is commonly referred to as ''&quot;Campidoglio&quot;'', the Italian name of the hill.

====Administrative and historical subdivisions====
[[File:Rome - Overview numbered.PNG|thumb|left|The 19 ''municipi'' of Rome.]]
Since 1972 the city has been divided into 19 (originally 20) &lt;ref&gt;In 1992 after a [[referendum]] the XIX Circoscrizione became the ''[[Comune]]'' of [[Fiumicino]]&lt;/ref&gt; administrative areas, called ''municipi''  (sing. ''municipio'') (until 2001 named ''circoscrizioni''). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Territorio |publisher=Comune di Roma |accessdate=5 October 2009 |url=http://www.comune.roma.it/was/wps/portal/!ut/p/_s.7_0_A/7_0_21L?menuPage=/Area_di_navigazione/Sezioni_del_portale/Dipartimenti_e_altri_uffici/Dipartimento_XV/www-9-romastatistica-9-it/Territorio/&amp;flagSub=|language=Italian}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were created for administrative reasons to increase decentralisation in the city. Each ''municipio'' is governed by a president and a council of four members who are elected by its residents every five years. The ''municipi'' frequently cross the boundaries of the traditional, non-administrative divisions of the city.

Rome is also divided into differing types of non-administrative units. The historic centre is divided into 22 ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'', all of which are located within the [[Aurelian Walls]] except [[Prati]] and [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]].

These originate from the [[14 regions of Augustan Rome|Regiones of ancient Rome]], which evolved in the Middle Ages into the [[14 regions of Medieval Rome|medieval rioni]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romeartlover.it/Rioni.html |title=The &quot;Rioni&quot; of Rome |publisher=Romeartlover.it |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Renaissance]], under Pope [[Sixtus V]], they reached again the number of fourteen, and their boundaries were finally defined under [[Pope Benedict XIV]] in 1743.

A new subdivision of the city under [[Napoleon]] was ephemeral, and there were no sensible changes in the organisation of the city until 1870, when Rome became the third capital of Italy. The needs of the new capital led to an explosion both in the urbanisation and in the population within and outside the [[Aurelian Walls|Aurelian walls]]. In 1874 a fifteenth rione, [[Esquilino (rione of Rome)|Esquilino]], was created on the newly urbanised zone of [[Monti (rione of Rome)|Monti]]. At the beginning of the 20th century other rioni where created (the last one was Prati ? the only one outside the Walls of [[Pope Urban VIII]] ? in 1921). Afterward, for the new administrative subdivisions of the city the name &quot;quartiere&quot; was used. Today all the rioni, except Borgo and Prati, are part of the first Municipio, which therefore coincides almost completely with the ''historical city'' (''Centro Storico'').

===Provincial and regional government===
Rome is the principal town of the [[Province of Rome|homonymous Province]], which includes the city's metropolitan area and extends further north until [[Civitavecchia]].  The Province of Rome is the 9th largest by area in Italy. At {{convert|5352|km?}}, its dimensions are comparable to the region of [[Liguria]]. Moreover, the city is also the capital of the [[Lazio]] region.

===National government===
Rome is the national capital of Italy and is the seat of the [[Politics of Italy|Italian Government]]. The official residences of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]] and the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]], the seats of both houses of the [[Parliament of Italy|Italian Parliament]] and that of the [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Italian Constitutional Court]] are located in the historic centre. The state ministries are spread out around the city; these include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is located in [[Palazzo della Farnesina]] near the Olympic stadium.

==Geography==
[[File:Rome, Italy.JPG|thumb|Astronaut View of Rome]]

===Location===
Rome is in the [[Lazio]] region of [[central Italy]] on the [[Tiber River|Tiber]] river ({{lang-it|Tevere}}). The original settlement developed on hills that faced onto a ford beside the [[Tiber Island]], the only natural ford of the river in this area. The Rome of the Kings was built on seven hills: the [[Aventine Hill]], the [[Caelian Hill]], the [[Capitoline Hill]], the [[Esquiline Hill]], the [[Palatine Hill]], the [[Quirinal Hill]], and the [[Viminal Hill]]. Modern Rome is also crossed by another river the [[Aniene]] which flows into the Tiber north of the historic centre.

Although the city center is about {{convert|24|km|mi|0}} inland from the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], the city territory extends to the shore, where the south-western district of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]] is located. The altitude of the central part of Rome ranges from {{convert|13|m|0}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]] (at the base of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]) to {{convert|139|m|0}} above sea level (the peak of [[Monte Mario]]).&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Comune'' of Rome covers an overall area of about {{convert|1285|km2|0}}, including many green areas.

===Topography===
[[File:Rome L7 8 3 2001 lrg.jpg|thumb|Rome seen from satellite.]]

Throughout the history of Rome, the urban limits of the city were considered to be the area within the city walls. Originally, these consisted of the [[Servian Wall]], which was built twelve years after the [[Gaul]]ish sack of the city in 390 BC. This contained most of the Esquiline and Caelian hills, as well as the whole of the other five. Rome outgrew the [[Servian Wall]], but no more walls were constructed until almost 700 years later, when, in 270 AD, Emperor [[Aurelian]] began building the [[Aurelian Walls]]. These were almost {{convert |19|km|0}} long, and were still the walls the troops of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861?1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] had to breach to enter the city in 1870. Modern Romans frequently consider the city's urban area to be delimited by its ring-road, the ''[[Grande Raccordo Anulare]]'', which circles the city centre at a distance of about 10&amp;nbsp;km.

The ''Comune'' of Rome, however, covers considerably more territory and extends to the sea at [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]], the largest town in Italy that is not a ''comune'' in its own right. The ''comune'' covers an area roughly three times the total area within the ''Raccordo'' and is comparable in area to the entire provinces of [[Milan]] and [[Naples]], and to an area six times the size of the territory of these cities. It also includes considerable areas of abandoned marsh land which is suitable neither for agriculture nor for urban development.

As a consequence, the density of the ''comune'' is not that high, its territory being divided between highly urbanised areas and areas designated as parks, nature reserves, and for agricultural use.

==Climate==

Rome enjoys a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[K?ppen climate classification]]: ''Csa''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/

Spring and autumn are mild to warm, and the Romans ''ottobrate'' (&quot;beautiful October days&quot;) are known as being sunny and warm. By August, the maximum diurnal temperature often exceeds {{convert|30|?C}}. Traditionally, many businesses were accustomed to closing during August, while Romans visited holiday resorts. In more recent years, however, in response to growing tourism and changing work habits, the city has been staying open for the whole summer. The average high temperature in January is about {{convert|12.9|?C|1}}, but in hot periods it can be higher, while subzero lows are not uncommon. Snowfalls can occur in the winter months, but are rare. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meteo-net.it/articoli/storiconeve.aspx|title=Storia della neve a Roma|accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Generally ? summer's season lasts about 6 months, from May to October. Two months (April and November) are transitional, sometimes there are temperature above {{convert|20|?C|0|abbr=on}}. December, January, February and March are the coldest months, with average temperatures (of these four months) over {{convert|13.1|?C|?F|abbr=on}} near the city centre ({{convert|13.9|?C|?F|abbr=on}} near sea) during the day and {{convert|3.7|?C|?F|abbr=on}} near the city centre ({{convert|4.7|?C|?F|abbr=on}} near sea) at night. The average [[relative humidity]] is 74.8%, varying from 72% in July to 77% in November and December.

At the time of the Emperor [[Augustus]], Rome was the largest city in the world: with a population of about one million people (about the size of London in the early 19th century, when London was the largest city in the world).&lt;ref&gt;N.Morley, ''Metropolis and Hinterland'' (Cambridge, 1996) 33?9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duiker, 2001. page 149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-20586744.html ''Abstrat of'' The population of ancient Rome.] by Glenn R.

Originally published in ''Classical Philology''.
Vol. 29, No. 2 (April 1934), pp101-116. Retrieved 2007-4-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Western Roman Empire]], the city's population fell dramatically to less than 50,000 people, and continued to either stagnate or shrink until the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Llewellyn, ''Rome in the Dark Ages'' (London 1993), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861?1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] annexed Rome in 1870, the city had a population of about 200,000, which rapidly increased to 600,000 by the eve of World War I. The [[Fascism|Fascist]] regime of Mussolini tried to block an excessive demographic rise of the city, but failed to prevent it from reaching one million people by early 1930s. After the Second World War, growth continued, helped by a post-war economic boom. A construction boom also created a large number of suburbs during the 1950s and 1960s.

In mid-2010, there were 2,754,440 residents in the city proper, while some 4.2&amp;nbsp;million people lived in the greater Rome area (which can be approximately identified with its administrative [[Province of Rome|province]], with a population density of about 800inhab./km2 stretching over more than 5,000 km2). Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 17.00 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 20.76 percent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 percent (minors) and 19.94 percent (pensioners). The average age of a Roman resident is 43 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Rome grew by 6.54 percent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.56 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demo.istat.it/bil2007/index.html |title=Statistiche demografiche ISTAT |publisher=Demo.istat.it |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current birth rate of Rome is 9.10 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.

===Ethnic groups===
According to the latest statistics conducted by ISTAT,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demo.istat.it/str2009/index.html |title=Statistiche demografiche ISTAT |publisher=Demo.istat.it |accessdate=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; approximately 9.5% of the population consists of non-Italians. About half of the immigrant population consists of those of various other European origins (chiefly Romanian, Polish, Ukrainian, and Albanian) numbering a combined total of 131,118 or 4.7 percent of the population. The remaining 4.8 percent are those with non-European origins, chiefly Filipinos (26,933), Bangladeshis (12,154), Peruvians (10,530), and Chinese (10,283).

The Esquilino district, off [[Termini Station (Rome)|Termini Railway Station]], has evolved into a largely immigrant neighbourhood, it is now seen as Rome's Chinatown, but in fact immigrants from more than a hundred different countries crowd its busy streets and piazzas. A thriving commercial district, Esquilino boasts dozens of restaurants featuring every kind of international cuisine. There are innumerable wholesale clothes shops: of the 1,300 or so commercial premises operating in the district 800 are Chinese-owned, around 300 are run by immigrants from other countries around the world and some 200 are owned by Italians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romepost.it/Rioni_of_Rome_Esquilino.htm Rome Post ? what's happening in Rome]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to serve the growing number Muslims community, in 1995 the first [[Mosque of Rome|Mosque in Rome]] was inaugurated, the largest mosque in Europe.

Hundreds of [[Romani people|Romani gypsies]] live in illegal trailer camps on the city's outskirts. There is a growing population of homeless people in Rome, mostly not Italian and estimated at 7000.

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in Rome}}
[[File:Vatikan Kolonaden Petersdom.jpg|thumb|center|800px|&lt;center&gt;[[Saint Peter's Square|St. Peter's Square]] in [[Vatican City]].&lt;/center&gt;]]
Much like the rest of Italy, Rome is predominantly Roman Catholic, and the city has been an important centre of religion and pilgrimage for centuries, the base of the ancient Roman Religion with the [[Pontifex Maximus|pontifex maximus]] and later the seat of the [[Vatican City]] and the pope. Before the arrival of the Christians in Rome, the [[Religion in ancient Rome|Religio Romana]] (literally, the &quot;Roman Religion&quot;) was the major religion of the city in classical antiquity. The first gods held sacred by the Romans were [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the most high, and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], god of war, and father of Rome's twin founders, [[Romulus and Remus]], according to tradition. Other gods and goddesses such as [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] and [[Minerva]] were honoured. Rome was also the base of several mystery cults, such as [[Mithraic Mysteries|Mithraism]]. Later, after [[Saint Peter|St Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|St Paul]] were martyred in the city, and the first Christians began to arrive, Rome became Christian, and the St. Peter's Basilica was first constructed in 313 AD. Despite some interruptions (such as the [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon papacy]]), Rome has for centuries been the home of the Roman Catholic Church and the [[Pope|bishop of Rome]], otherwise known as the pope.
[[File:Facade San Giovanni in Laterano 2006-09-07.jpg|thumb|[[Basilica of St. John Lateran]], Rome's Cathedral.]]
Despite the fact that Rome is home to the Vatican City and [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Rome's cathedral is the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]], located to the south-east of the city-centre. There are around 900 churches in Rome in total, aside from the cathedral itself, some others of note include: the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]], the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]], the [[Basilica di San Clemente]], [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]] and the [[Church of the Gesu]]. There are also the ancient [[Catacombs of Rome]] underneath the city. Numerous highly important religious educational institutions are also in Rome, such as the [[Pontifical Lateran University]], [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]], [[Pontifical Gregorian University]], and [[Pontifical Oriental Institute]].

The territory of Vatican City is part of the ''Mons Vaticanus'', and of the adjacent former Vatican Fields, where [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Apostolic Palace]], the [[Sistine Chapel]], and museums were built, along with various other buildings. The area was part of the Roman [[rione]] of [[borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] until 1929. Being separated from the city on the west bank of the [[Tiber River|Tiber]] river, the area was an outcrop of the city that was protected by being included within the walls of [[Pope Leo IV|Leo IV]], later expanded by the current fortification walls of [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]]/[[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]]/[[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]]. [[File:Piazza Esquilino, Santa Maria Maggiore.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]] is one of the largest churches in the city.]]

When the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 that gave the state its present form was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory was influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. For some tracts of the frontier, there was no wall, but the line of certain buildings supplied part of the boundary, and for a small part of the frontier a modern wall was constructed.

The territory includes [[Saint Peter's Square]], separated from the territory of Italy only by a white line along the limit of the square, where it touches Piazza Pio XII. St. Peter's Square is reached through the [[Via della Conciliazione]], which runs from the Tiber River to St. Peter's. This grand approach was constructed by [[Benito Mussolini]] after the conclusion of the Lateran Treaty. According to the Lateran Treaty, certain [[properties of the Holy See]] that are located in Italian territory, most notably [[Castel Gandolfo]] and the [[major basilica]]s, enjoy extraterritorial status similar to that of foreign [[Diplomatic mission|embassies]].

In recent years, there has been a significant growth in Rome's Muslim community, mainly due to immigration from North African and Middle Eastern countries into the city. As a consequence of this increase of the local practitioners of the Islamic faith, the ''comune'' promoted the building of the largest mosque in Europe, which was designed by architect [[Paolo Portoghesi]] and inaugurated on 21 June 1995. Since the end of the Roman Republic Rome is also the center of an important Jewish community,&lt;ref&gt;Coarelli, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; which was once based in [[Trastevere]], and later in the [[Roman Ghetto]]. There lies also the major synagogue in Rome, the ''[[Great Synagogue of Rome|Tempio Maggiore]]''.

===Architecture===
{{Main|Architecture of Rome}}

[[File:Pantheon Front.jpg|thumb|The [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]].]]

Rome's architecture over the centuries has greatly developed, especially from the Classical and Imperial Roman styles to modern [[Fascist architecture]]. Rome was for a period one of the world's main epicentres of classical architecture, developing new forms such as the [[arch]], the [[dome]] and the [[vault (architecture)|vault]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Eyewitness&quot;&gt;Eyewitness Travel (2006), pg.36?37.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries was also widely used in Roman architecture, and later the city became one of the main centres of [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] architecture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eyewitness&quot;/&gt;

====Ancient Rome====

{{Main|List of ancient monuments in Rome|Ancient Roman architecture}}
One of the symbols of Rome is the [[Colosseum]] (70?80 AD), the largest [[amphitheatre]] ever built in the [[Roman Empire]]. Originally capable of seating 60,000 spectators, it was used for [[gladiator]]ial combat. A list of important monuments and sites of ancient Rome includes the [[Roman Forum]], the [[Domus Aurea]], the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], [[Trajan's Column]], [[Trajan's Market]], the [[Catacombs of Rome|Catacombs]], the [[Circus Maximus]], the [[Baths of Caracalla]], [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]], the [[Ara Pacis]], the [[Arch of Constantine]], the [[Pyramid of Cestius]], and the [[Bocca della Verit?]].

====Medieval====
Often overlooked, Rome's medieval heritage is one of the largest in Italian cities. Basilicas dating from the [[Early Christianity|Paleochristian]] age include [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Santa Maria Maggiore]] and [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|San Paolo Fuori le Mura]] (the latter largely rebuilt in the 19th century), both housing precious 4th century AD mosaics. Later notable medieval mosaic and fresco art can be also found in the churches of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], [[Santi Quattro Coronati]], and [[Santa Prassede]]. Lay buildings include a number of towers, the largest being the [[Torre delle Milizie]] and the [[Torre dei Conti]], both next the Roman Forum, and the huge staircase leading to the basilica of [[Santa Maria in Aracoeli|Santa Maria in Ara Coeli]].

====Renaissance and Baroque====
Rome was a major world centre of the [[Renaissance]], second only to [[Florence]], and was profoundly affected by the movement. Among others, a masterpiece of [[Renaissance architecture]] in Rome is the [[Capitoline Hill|Piazza del Campidoglio]] by [[Michelangelo]]. During this period, the great aristocratic families of Rome used to build opulent dwellings as the [[Quirinal Palace|Palazzo del Quirinale]] (now seat of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]]), the [[Palazzo Venezia]], the [[Palazzo Farnese]], the [[Palazzo Barberini]], the [[Palazzo Chigi]] (now seat of the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]]), the [[Palazzo Spada]], the [[Palazzo della Cancelleria]], and the [[Villa Farnesina]].

{{wide image|Piazza del Campidoglio panoramic view 39948px.jpg|800px|&lt;center&gt;Panoramic view of [[Piazza del Campidoglio]], with the [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius]].&lt;/center&gt;}}

Many of the famous city's squares ? some huge, majestic and often adorned with [[List of obelisks in Rome|obelisks]], some small and pictoresque ? got their present shape during the Renaissance and Baroque. The principal ones are [[Piazza Navona]], [[Spanish Steps|Piazza di Spagna]], [[Campo de' Fiori]], [[Piazza Venezia]], [[Palazzo Farnese, Rome|Piazza Farnese]], [[Pantheon, Rome|Piazza della Rotonda]] and [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva|Piazza della Minerva]]. One of the most emblematic examples of [[Baroque|Baroque art]] is the [[Trevi Fountain|Fontana di Trevi]] by [[Nicola Salvi]]. Other notable 17th-century [[baroque architecture|baroque palaces]] are the [[Palazzo Madama]], now the seat of the [[Italian Senate]] and the [[Palazzo Montecitorio]], now the seat of the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies of Italy]].

====Neoclassicism====

[[File:RomaAltarePatriaTramonto.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II]].]]
[[File:Roma Piazza del Popolo BW 1.JPG|thumb|left|[[Piazza del Popolo]].]]
[[File:Palazzo della Farnesina.jpg|thumb|right|[[Palazzo della Farnesina]], seat of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.]]

In 1870, Rome became the capital city of the new [[Kingdom of Italy (1861?1946)|Kingdom of Italy]]. During this time, [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassicism]], a building style influenced by the architecture of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], became a predominant influence in [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman architecture]]. During this period, many great palaces in neoclassical styles were built to host ministries, embassies, and other governing agencies. One of the best-known symbols of Roman neoclassicism is the [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II|Monument of Vittorio Emanuele II]] or &quot;Altar of the Fatherland&quot;, where the [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II#Unknown soldier|Grave of the Unknown Soldier]], that represents the 650,000 Italians that fell in World War I, is located.

====Fascist architecture====
{{See also|Fascist architecture}}

The Fascist regime that ruled in Italy between 1922 and 1943 developed an architectural style that was characterised by its links with ancient Roman architecture. The most important Fascist site in Rome is the [[EUR, Rome|E.U.R]] district, designed in 1938 by [[Marcello Piacentini]]. It was originally conceived for the [[Esposizione universale (1942)|1942 world exhibition]], and was called &quot;E.42&quot; (''&quot;Esposizione 42&quot;''). The world exhibition, however, never took place because Italy entered the Second World War in 1940. The most representative building of the Fascist style at E.U.R. is the [[Palazzo della Civilt? Italiana]] (1938?1943), the iconic design of which has been labelled the cubic of Square Colosseum. After World War II, the Roman authorities found that they already had the seed of an off-centre business district of the type that other capitals were still planning ([[London Docklands]] and [[La D?fense]] in Paris). Also the [[Palazzo della Farnesina]], the current seat of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], was designed in 1935 in pure Fascist style.

===Parks and gardens===
[[File:Rome-VillaBorghese-TempleEsculape.jpg|thumb|left|The gardens of [[Villa Borghese gardens|Villa Borghese]].]]
{{Main|List of parks and gardens in Rome}}
Public parks and nature reserves cover a large area in Rome, and the city has one of the largest areas of green space amongst European capitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romaperkyoto.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=35&amp;Itemid=52|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080204030918/http://www.romaperkyoto.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=35&amp;Itemid=52|archivedate=4 February 2008 |title=Green Areas |publisher=RomaPerKyoto.org |accessdate=9 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable part of this green space is represented by the large number of villas and landscaped gardens created by the Italian aristocracy. While many villas were destroyed during the building boom of the late 19th century, a great many remain. The most notable of these are [[Villa Borghese gardens|Villa Borghese]], [[Villa Ada]], and [[Villa Doria Pamphili]]. Villa Doria Pamphili is west of the Gianicolo hill comprising some 1.8&amp;nbsp;km2. Also on the Gianicolo hill there is Villa Sciarra, with playgrounds for children and shaded walking areas. In the nearby area of Trastevere the Orto Botanico (Botanical Garden) is a cool and shady green space. The old Roman hippodrome (Circus Maximus) is another large green space but the main attraction is the ancient site of the chariot racing and it has few trees. Nearby is the lush Villa Celimontana, close to the gardens surrounding the Baths of Caracalla and Rose Garden (?roseto comunale?). The Villa Borghese garden is the best known large green space in Rome, with famous art galleries among its shaded walks. It is close to the Spanish Steps that climb the slope to the Piazza Trinita dei Monti from the Piazza di Spagna,and [[Piazza del Popolo]] with its Augustinian Church built in the 13th century. Rome also has a number of regional parks of much more recent origin including the [[Pineto Regional Park]] and the Appian Way Regional Park. There are also nature reserves at Marcigliana and at Tenuta di Castelporziano.

===Fountains and aqueducts===

Rome is a city famous for its numerous fountains, built in all different styles, from Classical and Medieval, to Baroque and Neoclassical. The city has had [[fountain]]s for more than two thousand years, and they have provided drinking water and decorated the [[piazza]]s of Rome. During the [[Roman Empire]], in 98 AD, according to [[Sextus Julius Frontinus]], the Roman consul who was named ''curator aquarum'' or guardian of the water of the city, Rome had nine [[aqueduct]]s which fed 39 monumental fountains and 591 public basins, not counting the water supplied to the Imperial household, baths and owners of private villas. Each of the major fountains was connected to two different aqueducts, in case one was shut down for service.&lt;ref&gt;Frontin, Les Aqueducs de la ville de Rome, translation and commentary by Pierre Grimal, Soci?t? d'?dition Les Belles Lettres, Paris, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th and 18th century the Roman popes reconstructed other ruined Roman acqueducts and built new display fountains to mark their termini, launching the golden age of the Roman fountain. The fountains of Rome, like the paintings of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], were expressions of the new style of [[Baroque]] art. They were crowded with allegorical figures, and filled with emotion and movement. In these fountains, sculpture became the principal element, and the water was used simply to animate and decorate the sculptures. They, like baroque gardens, were &quot;a visual representation of confidence and power.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Italian Gardens, a Cultural History'', Helen Attlee.

===Statues===

Rome is well known for its statues but, in particular, the [[talking statues of Rome]]. These are usually ancient statues which have become popular soapboxes for political and social discussion, and places for people to (often satirically) voice their opinions. There are two main talking statues: the [[Pasquino]] and the [[Marforio]], yet there are four other noted ones: [[il Babuino]], [[Madama Lucrezia]], [[il Facchino]] and [[Abbot Luigi]]. Most of these statues are ancient Roman or classical, and most of them also depict mythical gods, ancient people or legendary figures; il Pasquino represents [[Menelaus]], Abbot Luigi is an unknown Roman magistrate, il Babuino is supposed to be [[Silenus]], [[Marforio]] represents [[Oceanus]], Madama Lucrezia is a bust of [[Isis]], and [[il Facchino]] is the only non-Roman statue, created in 1580, and not representing anyone in particular. They are often, due to their status, covered with placards or [[graffiti]] expressing political ideas and points of view. Other statues in the city, which are not related to the talking statues, include those of the Ponte Sant'Angelo, or several monuments scattered across the city, such as that to [[Giordano Bruno]] in the Campo de'Fiori.

===Obelisks and columns===
{{Main|List of obelisks in Rome}}
The city contains eight [[ancient Egypt]]ian and five [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[obelisk]]s, together with a number of more modern obelisks; there was also formerly (until 2005) an [[Aksumite Empire|ancient Ethiopian]] obelisk in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.initaly.com/regions/classic/obelisks.htm |title=Chasing Obelisks in Rome |publisher=Initaly.com |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city contains some of obelisks in [[piazza]]s, such as in [[Piazza Navona]], [[Saint Peter's Square|St Peter's Square]], [[Piazza di Monte Citorio|Piazza Montecitorio]], and [[Piazza del Popolo]], and others in [[villa]]s, [[thermae]] parks and gardens, such as in [[Villa Mattei|Villa Celimontana]], the [[Baths of Diocletian]], and the [[Pincian Hill]]. Moreover, the centre of Rome hosts also [[Trajan's column|Trajan's]] and [[Column of Marcus Aurelius|Antonine Column]], two ancient Roman columns with spiral relief.

===Bridges===
{{Main|List of bridges in Rome}}
[[File:Bridge of Angels.jpg|thumb|[[Ponte Sant'Angelo|Bridge of Angels]] which leads to [[Castel Sant'Angelo]].]]
The city of Rome contains numerous famous bridges which cross the [[Tiber River|Tiber]]. Famous ones include the [[Pons Cestius|Ponte Cestio]], the [[Ponte Milvio]], the [[Ponte Nomentano]], the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo]], the [[Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II]], the [[Ponte Sisto]] and the [[Pons Fabricius|Ponte dei Quattro Capi]]. Currently there are five [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] bridges still remaining in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citrag.it/archi/page/bridges/e_f_pn_ro.htm |title=The Bridges of Ancient Rome |publisher=Citrag.it |accessdate=3 February 2010}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the city's public bridges were built in Classical or Renaissance style, but also in Baroque, Neoclassical and Modern styles. According to the [[Encyclop?dia Britannica]], the finest ancient bridge remaining in Rome is the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo]], which was completed in 135AD, and was decorated with 10 statues of the angels, designed by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]] in 1688.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Encyclop?dia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/523159/SantAngelo-Bridge |title=Sant'Angelo Bridge |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catacombs===
{{Main|Catacombs of Rome}}
Rome has extensive amount of ancient catacombs, or underground burial places under or near the city, of which there are at least forty, some discovered only in recent decades. Though most famous for Christian burials, they include [[Religion in ancient Rome|pagan]] and Jewish burials, either in separate catacombs or mixed together. The first large-scale catacombs were excavated from the 2nd century onwards. Originally they were carved through [[tuff]], a soft [[volcanic rock]], outside the boundaries of the city, because [[Roman law]] forbade burial places within city limits. Currently maintenance of the catacombs is in the hands of the [[Pope|Papacy]] which has invested in the [[Salesians of Don Bosco]] the supervision of the Catacombs of St. Callixtus on the outskirts of Rome.

==Economy==

Being the capital city of Italy, Rome hosts all the principal institutions of the nation, like the Presidency of the Republic, the government (and its single Ministeri), the Parliament, the main judicial Courts, and the diplomatic representatives of all the countries for the states of Italy and the Vatican City (curiously, Rome also hosts, in the Italian part of its territory, the Embassy of Italy for the Vatican City, a unique case of an Embassy within the boundaries of its own country). Many international institutions are located in Rome, notably cultural and scientific ones ? such as the American Institute, the British School, the French Academy, the Scandinavian Institutes, the German Archaeological Institute ? for the honour of scholarship in the Eternal City, and humanitarian ones, such as the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]]. Rome, also hosts major international and worldwide political and cultural organisations, such as the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD), [[World Food Programme]] (WFP), the [[NATO Defence College]] and ICCROM, the International Center for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property [http://www.iccrom.org/]. Rome is currently an beta+ [[Global city|world city]], falling down from its alpha- status in 2008, along with [[Berlin]], [[Stockholm]], [[Athens]], [[Prague]], [[Montreal]] and [[Vancouver]], to name a few.&lt;ref name=&quot;lboro.ac.uk&quot;/&gt; With a score of 2.56, Rome was also ranked in 2010 as 28th in the Global Cities Index (moving up two places from its 2008 position), being the highest-ranking city in Italy (Milan comes second at 42nd).&lt;ref name=&quot;atkearney.at&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, Rome was in 2008, also ranked 15th out of all the cities of the world for global importance, mainly for cultural experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4509 |title=The 2008 Global Cities Index |publisher=Foreignpolicy.com |date=15 October 2008 |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a 2005 GDP of ?94.376&amp;nbsp;billion (US$121.5&amp;nbsp;billion),&lt;ref name=&quot;rapporto2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censis.it/277/372/5732/5766/5783/5784/content.asp |title=Rapporto Censis 2006 |publisher=Censis.it |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the city produces 6.7% of the national GDP (more than any other single city in Italy), and its unemployment rate, lowered from 11.1% to 6.5% between 2001 and 2005, is now one of the lowest rates of all the European Union capital cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;rapporto2006&quot;/&gt; Rome grows +4.4% annually and continues to grow at a higher rate in comparison to any other city in the rest of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;rapporto2006&quot;/&gt; This means that were Rome a country, it would be the world's 52nd richest country by GDP, near to the size to that of Egypt. Rome also had a 2003 GDP per capita of ?29,153 (US$ 37,412), which was second in Italy, (after [[Milan]]), and is more than 134.1% of the EU average GDP per capita.&lt;ref name=&quot;observatoribarcelona.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.observatoribarcelona.org/eng/Indicadors.php?IdentificadorTema=1&amp;Identificador=11 Observatoribarcelona.org]{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rome, on the whole, has the highest total earnings in Italy, reaching ?47,076,890,463 in 2008,&lt;ref name=&quot;ilsole24ore.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/speciali/redditi_comuni_08/ |title=La classifica dei redditi nei comuni capoluogo di provincia |publisher=Il Sole 24 ORE |accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet, in terms of average workers' incomes, the city places itself 9th in Italy, with ?24,509&lt;ref name=&quot;ilsole24ore.com&quot;/&gt; On a global level, Rome's workers receive the 30th highest wages in 2009, coming three places higher than in 2008, in which the city ranked 33rd.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/economics/richest_cities.html |title=World's richest cities in 2009 |publisher=City Mayors |date=22 August 2009 |accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the economy of Rome is characterised by the absence of heavy industry and it is largely dominated by [[service (economics)|services]], high-technology companies (IT, aerospace, defence, telecommunications), research, construction and commercial activities (especially banking), and the huge development of tourism are very dynamic and extremely important to its economy. Rome's international airport, [[Fiumicino]], is the largest in Italy, and the city hosts the head offices of the vast majority of the major Italian companies, as well as the headquarters of three of the world's 100 largest companies: [[Enel]], [[Eni]], and [[Telecom Italia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Forbes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2006/03/29/06f2k_worlds-largest-public-companies_land.html|title=The World's 2000 Largest Public Companies|first=Scott|last=DeCarlo |date=30 March 2006 |work=Forbes|accessdate=16 January 2007}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Universities, national radio and television and the movie industry in Rome are also important parts of the economy: Rome is also the hub of the [[Cinema of Italy|Italian film industry]], thanks to the [[Cinecitt?]] studios, working since the 1930s. The city is also a centre for banking and insurance as well as electronics, energy, transport, and aerospace industries. Numerous international companies and agencies headquarters, government ministries, conference centres, sports venues, and museums are located in Rome's principal business districts: the [[Esposizione Universale Roma]] (EUR); the ''Torrino'' (further south from the EUR); the ''Magliana''; the ''Parco de' Medici-Laurentina'' and the so-called ''Tiburtina-valley'' along the ancient [[Via Tiburtina]].

==Education==
Rome is a nation-wide and major international centre for higher education, containing numerous academies, colleges and universities. According to the City Brands Index, Rome is considered the world's second most historically, educationally and culturally interesting and beautiful city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citybrandsindex.com/downloads/cbi2006-q4-free.pdf &quot;How the world views its cities&quot; ?

Rome is an important centre for music, and it has an intense musical scene, including several prestigious music conservatories and theatres. It hosts the [[Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia]] (founded in 1585), for which new concert halls have been built in the new [[Parco della Musica]], one of the largest musical venues in the world. Rome also has an opera house, the [[Teatro dell'Opera di Roma]], as well as several minor musical institutions. The city also played host to the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|Eurovision Song Contest]] in 1991 and the [[MTV Europe Music Awards 2004|MTV Europe Music Awards]] in 2004.

Rome has also had a major impact in music history. The [[Roman School]] was a group of composers of predominantly church music, which were active in the city during the 16th and 17th centuries, therefore spanning the late [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and early [[Baroque music|Baroque]] eras. The term also refers to the music they produced. Many of the composers had a direct connection to the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and the [[Sistine Chapel|papal chapel]], though they worked at several churches; stylistically they are often contrasted with the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]] of composers, a concurrent movement which was much more progressive. By far the most famous composer of the Roman School is [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], whose name has been associated for four hundred years with smooth, clear, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] perfection. However, there were other composers working in Rome, and in a variety of styles and forms.

Rome today is one of the most important tourist destinations of the world, due to the incalculable immensity of its archaeological and artistic treasures, as well as for the charm of its unique traditions, the beauty of its panoramic views, and the majesty of its magnificent &quot;villas&quot; (parks). Among the most significant resources are the many museums ? (Musei Capitolini, the Vatican Museums, Galleria Borghese, including those dedicated to modern and contemporary art and great many others) ? [[aqueduct]]s, [[fountain]]s, churches, [[palace]]s, historical buildings, the [[monument]]s and ruins of the [[Roman Forum]], and the [[Catacombs]]. Rome is the 3rd most visited city in the EU, after London and Paris, and receives an average of 7?10&amp;nbsp;million tourists a year, which sometimes doubles on holy years. The [[Colosseum]] (4&amp;nbsp;million tourists) and the [[Vatican Museums]] (4.2&amp;nbsp;million tourists) are the 39th and 37th (respectively) most visited places in the world, according to a recent study.&lt;ref name=&quot;itvnews.tv&quot;&gt;[http://www.itvnews.tv/Blog/Blog/the-50-most-visited-places.html ITVnews.tv]{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rome is also widely recognised as a world [[fashion capital]]. Although not as important as [[Milan]], Rome is the world's 4th most important center for fashion in the world, according to the 2009 [[Global Language Monitor]] after [[Milan]], New York and Paris, and beating London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.languagemonitor.com/popular-culture/fashion |title=The Global Language Monitor ? Fashion |publisher=Languagemonitor.com |date=20 July 2009 |accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major luxury fashion houses and jewellery chains, such as [[Bulgari]], [[Fendi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fendi.com/ |title=Fendi|publisher=fendi.com |accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laura Biagiotti]] and [[Brioni (fashion)]], just to name a few, are headquartered or were founded in the city. Also, other major labels, such as [[Chanel]], [[Prada]], [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]], [[Armani]] and [[Versace]] have luxury boutiques in Rome, primarily along its prestigious and upscale [[Via Condotti|Via dei Condotti]].

{{Main|Roman cuisine}}
Rome's cuisine has evolved through centuries and periods of social, cultural, and political changes. Rome became a major gastronomical centre during [[Ancient Rome]]. Ancient [[Roman Cuisine]] was highly influenced by Ancient Greek culture, and after, the empire's enormous expansion exposed Romans to many new, provincial culinary habits and cooking techniques. In the beginning, the differences between social classes were not very great, but disparities developed with the empire's growth. Later, during the [[Renaissance]], Rome became well known as a centre of high-cuisine, since some of the best chefs of the time, worked for the popes. An example of this could be [[Bartolomeo Scappi]], who was a chef, working for [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]] in the Vatican kitchen, and he acquired fame in 1570 when his cookbook ''Opera dell'arte del cucinare'' was published. In the book he lists approximately 1000 recipes of the Renaissance [[cuisine]] and describes cooking techniques and tools, giving the first known picture of a [[fork]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rolland_1&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Rolland|2006|p=273}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the city is home to numerous formidable and traditional [[List of Italian dishes|Italian dishes]]. A Jewish influence can be seen, as Jews have lived in Rome since the 1st century BCE. Vegetables, especially [[artichoke|globe artichoke]]s, are common.&lt;ref&gt;Piras, 291.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of these include &quot;''[[Saltimbocca]] alla Romana''&quot; ? a veal cutlet, Roman-style; topped with raw ham and sage and simmered with white wine and butter; &quot;''[[Carciofi alla giudia]]''&quot; ? artichokes fried in olive oil, typical of Roman Jewish cooking; &quot;''[[Carciofi alla romana]]''&quot; ? artichokes Roman-style; outer leaves removed, stuffed with mint, garlic, breadcrumbs and braised; &quot;''[[Carbonara|Spaghetti alla carbonara]]''&quot; ? spaghetti with [[bacon]], [[egg (food)|eggs]] and [[pecorino]], and &quot;''[[Gnocchi]] di semolino alla romana''&quot; ? [[semolina]] dumpling, Roman-style, to name but a few.

Rome hosts the [[Cinecitt?]] Studios,&lt;ref name=&quot;romefile1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romefile.com/culture/cinecitta.php |title=history of Cinecitt? Studios in Rome |publisher=Romefile.com |accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest film and television production facility in continental Europe and the centre of the [[Cinema of Italy|Italian cinema]], where a large number of today's biggest box office hits are filmed. The {{convert|99|acre|ha|adj=on}} studio complex is {{convert|5.6|mi|km}} from the centre of Rome and is part of one of the biggest production communities in the world, second only to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]], with well over 5,000 professionals ? from period costume makers to visual effects specialists. More than 3,000 productions have been made on its lot, from recent features like [[The Passion of the Christ]], [[Gangs of New York]], [[Rome (TV series)|HBO's Rome]], [[The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou|The Life Aquatic]] and [[Dino De Laurentiis]]? [[The Decameron|Decameron]], to such cinema classics as [[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]], [[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]], and the films of [[Federico Fellini]].

Founded in 1937 by [[Benito Mussolini]], the studios were bombed by the [[Western Allies]] during the Second World War. In the 1950s, Cinecitt? was the filming location for several large American film productions, and subsequently became the studio most closely associated with [[Federico Fellini]]. Today Cinecitt? is the only studio in the world with pre-production, production, and full post-production facilities on one lot, allowing directors and producers to walk in with their script and &quot;walk out&quot; with a completed film.

===Language===
{{Main|Roman dialect|Latin}}
The original language of Rome was [[Latin]], which evolved during the [[Middle Ages]] into Italian. The latter emerged as the confluence of various regional dialects, among which the [[Tuscan Language|Tuscan dialect]] predominated, but the population of Rome also developed its own dialect, the [[Romanesco]]. The ancient ''Romanesco'', used during the [[Middle Ages]], was a southern Italian dialect, very close to the [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]]. The influence of the [[Florence|Florentine]] culture during the [[renaissance]], and, above all, the immigration to Rome of many Florentines, amongst them the two [[House of Medici|Medici]] Popes ([[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]]) and their suite, caused a major shift in the dialect, which began to resemble more the Tuscan varieties. This remained largely confined to Rome until the 19th century, but then expanded to other zones of [[Lazio]] ([[Civitavecchia]], [[Latina, Lazio|Latina]]), from the beginning of the 20th century, thanks to the rising population of Rome and to better transportation systems. As a consequence, [[Romanesco]] abandoned its traditional forms to mutate into the dialect spoken within the city, which is more like standard Italian, although it remains distinct from the other Romanesco-influenced local dialects of Lazio. Dialectal literature in the traditional form [[Romanesco]] includes the works of such authors as [[Giuseppe Gioachino Belli]], [[Trilussa]], and [[Cesare Pascarella]]. Contemporary [[Romanesco]] is mainly represented by popular actors such as [[Aldo Fabrizi]], [[Alberto Sordi]], [[Nino Manfredi]], [[Anna Magnani]], [[Gigi Proietti]], [[Enrico Montesano]], and [[Carlo Verdone]].

Rome's historic contribution to language in a worldwide sense is much more extensive however. Through the process of [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanisation]], the peoples of [[Gallia]], the [[Iberian Peninsula]], Italy and [[Dacia]] developed languages which derive directly from Latin and were adopted in large areas of the world both through colonization and cultural influence. Moreover, also modern English, because of the [[Norman Conquest]], borrowed a large percentage of its vocabulary from the Latin Language. The Roman or Latin alphabet is the most widely used writing system in the world used by the greatest number of languages.&lt;ref&gt;Ostler, N. (2007), Ad Infinitum: A Biography of Latin. London: HarperCollins&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
[[File:Stadio Olimpico 2008.JPG|thumb|[[Stadio Olimpico]], one of the largest in Europe, with a capacity of over 70,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maspostatevilaregina.com/2009/05/05/brief-guide-to-olympic-stadium-of-rome/ |title=Brief Guide to Olympic Stadium of Rome &amp;#124; SPOSTARE LA FINALE DA ROMA? NO! GRAZIE |publisher=Maspostatevilaregina.com |date=23 April 2009 |accessdate=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Association football|Football (soccer)]] is the most popular sport in Rome, as in the rest of the country. The city hosted the final games of the [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]] and [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]. The latter took place in the [[Stadio Olimpico|Olympic Stadium]], which is also the home stadium for local [[Serie A]] clubs [[A.S. Roma]] and [[S.S. Lazio]], whose rivalry has become a staple of Roman sports culture. Footballers who play for these teams and are also born in the city tend to become especially popular, as has been the case with players such as [[Francesco Totti]] and [[Daniele De Rossi]] (both for A.S. Roma). [[Atletico Roma]] is a minor team that plays in [[Lega Pro Prima Divisione|First Division]]; its home stadium is [[Stadio Flaminio]].

Rome hosted the [[1960 Summer Olympics]], with great success, using many ancient sites such as the [[Villa Borghese]] and the [[Baths of Caracalla|Thermae of Caracalla]] as venues. For the Olympic Games many new structures were created, notably the new large Olympic Stadium (which was also enlarged and renewed to host qualification and the final match of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]), the Villaggio Olimpico (Olympic Village, created to host the athletes and redeveloped after the games as a residential district), etc. Rome made a [[Rome bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics|bid]] to host the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] but it was withdrawn before the deadline for applicant files.&lt;ref name=&quot;olympic.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/media?articleid=138217 |title=Media |publisher=Olympic.org |date=|accessdate=2011-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bladesplace.id.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bladesplace.id.au/olympic-games-candidates.html |title=Candidate Cities for Future Olympic Games |publisher=Bladesplace.id.au |accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rugby union]] is gaining wider acceptance. The [[Stadio Flaminio]] is the home stadium for the [[Italy national rugby union team]], which has been playing in the [[Six Nations Championship]] since 2000, albeit with less than satisfactory performances, as they have never won the championship. Rome is home to local rugby teams, such as [[Unione Rugby Capitolina]], [[Rugby Roma]], and [[S.S. Lazio (rugby)|S.S. Lazio]].

Every May, Rome hosts the [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000|ATP Masters Series]] tennis tournament on the clay courts of the [[Foro Italico]]. Cycling was popular in the post-World War II period, although its popularity has faded. Rome has hosted the final portion of the [[Giro d'Italia]] twice, in 1989 and 2000. Rome is also home to other sports teams, including basketball ([[Pallacanestro Virtus Roma|Virtus Roma]]), volleyball ([[M. Roma Volley]]), [[team handball|handball]] or [[water polo|waterpolo]].

==Pilgrimage==
Rome has been a major Christian pilgrimage site since the Middle Ages. People from all over the Christian world visit Vatican City, within the city of Rome, the seat of the papacy. The Pope was the most influential figure during the Middle Ages. the city became a major pilgrimage site during the [[Middle Ages]] and the focus of struggles between the Papacy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] starting with [[Charlemagne]], who was crowned its first emperor in Rome in 800 by [[Pope Leo III]]. Apart from brief periods as an independent city during the [[Middle Ages]], Rome kept its status as Papal capital and &quot;holy city&quot; for centuries, even when the Papacy [[Avignon papacy|briefly relocated]] to [[Avignon]] (1309?1377). {{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Catholics believe that the Vatican is the last resting place of St. Peter. to this day, thousand of believers flock to the city to Rome. One of the pilgrimage stopping point is [[scala sancta|pilate's stairs]] where, according to the Christian tradition, the steps that led up to the [[praetorium]] of [[Pontius Pilate]] in [[Jerusalem]], which [[Jesus Christ]] stood on during his [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] on his way to trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/06/14/wsteps114.xml Steps Jesus walked to trial restored to glory], ''Daily Telegraph'', Malcolm Moore, 14/06/2007&lt;/ref&gt; The stairs were, reputedly, brought to Rome by [[Helena of Constantinople|St. Helena]] in the 4th Century. For centuries, the Scala Santa has attracted Christian pilgrims who wished to honor the Passion of Jesus.

==Transportation==
{{Main|Transport in Rome}}
[[File:Rom Fiumicino 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport|Rome-Fiumicino Airport]] in 2008 was the [[List of the busiest airports in Europe|sixth busiest airport]] in Europe.]]

Rome is at the centre of the radial network of roads that roughly follow the lines of the ancient Roman roads that began at the [[Capitoline Hill]] and connected Rome with its empire. Today Rome is circled, at a distance of about {{convert|10|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, by the ring-road (the ''[[Grande Raccordo Anulare]]'' or ''GRA'').

Due to its location in the centre of the Italian peninsula, Rome is a principal railway node for central Italy. Rome's main train station, [[Roma Termini railway station|Termini]], is one of the biggest train stations in Europe and the most heavily used in Italy, with around 400 thousand travellers passing through every day. The second-largest station in the city, [[Roma Tiburtina railway station|Roma Tiburtina]], is currently being redeveloped as a [[High-speed rail in Italy|high-speed rail]] terminus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080523201048/http://eurostar-av.trenitalia.com/it/progetto/stazioni_rinnovate/roma_tiburtina.html ? Entry on Roma Tiburtina station on the official website of the Italian high-speed rail service] {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rome is served by three airports. The intercontinental [[Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport|Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport]] is Italy's chief airport and is commonly known as &quot;Fiumicino Airport&quot;, as it is located within the nearby [[Fiumicino|''Comune'' of Fiumicino]], south-west of Rome. The older [[Rome Ciampino Airport]] is a joint civilian and military airport. It is commonly referred to as &quot;Ciampino Airport&quot;, as it is located beside [[Ciampino]], south-east of Rome. A third airport, the [[Roma-Urbe]] Airport, is a small, low-traffic airport located about 6&amp;nbsp;km north of the city centre, which handles most helicopter and private flights.

The city suffers from traffic problems largely due to this radial street pattern, making it difficult for Romans to move easily from the vicinity of one of the radial roads to another without going into the historic centre or using the ring-road. These problems are not helped by the limited size of Rome's metro system when compared to other cities of similar size. In addition, Rome has only 21 taxis for every 10,000 inhabitants, far below other major European cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Central Rome Streets Blocked by Taxi Drivers |work=New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/world/europe/30rome.html?scp=93&amp;sq=Rome&amp;st=nyt |date=30 November 2007 |accessdate=10 February 2008 |first=Peter |last=Kiefer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic congestion caused by cars during the 1970s and 1980s led to restrictions being placed on vehicle access to the inner city-centre during the hours of daylight. Areas where these restriction apply are known as Limited Traffic Zones (''Zona a Traffico Limitato'' (ZTL) in Italian). More recently, heavy night-time traffic in [[Trastevere]] and [[Quartiere San Lorenzo|San Lorenzo]] has led to the creation of night-time ZTLs in those districts, and there are also plans to create another night-time ZTL in [[Testaccio]].

[[File:Roma MetropolitanaC e Ferrovia 2011.svg|thumb|right|Overview map of Rome's underground and rail system in 2011]]

A 2-line metro system called the ''[[Rome Metro|Metropolitana]]'' operates in Rome. Construction on the first branch started in the 1930s. The line had been planned to quickly connect the [[Roma Termini railway station|main train station]] with the newly planned E42 area in the southern suburbs, where the 1942 [[Esposizione universale (1942)|World Fair]] was supposed to be held. The event never took place because of war. The area was later partly redesigned and renamed [[Esposizione Universale Roma|EUR]] (Esposizione Universale di Roma: Rome Universal Exhibition) in the 1950s to serve as a modern business district. The line was finally opened in 1955, and it is now part of the B Line.

The A line opened in 1980 from Ottaviano to Anagnina stations, later extended in stages (1999?2000) to Battistini. In the 1990s, an extension of the B line was opened from Termini to Rebibbia. This underground network is generally reliable (although it may become very congested at peak times and during events, especially the A line) as it is relatively short. As of 2005, its total length is {{convert|38|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.

The two existing lines, A and B, intersect at Roma Termini station. A new branch of the B line (B1) is under construction with an estimated cost of ?500&amp;nbsp;million. It is scheduled to open in 2012. B1 will connect to line B at Piazza Bologna and will have four stations over a distance of {{convert|3.9|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. A third line, line C, is under construction with an estimated cost of ?3&amp;nbsp;billion and will have 30 stations over a distance of {{convert|25.5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. It will partly replace the existing Rail Road line, Termini-Pantano. It will feature full automated, driverless trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Kington |title=Roman remains threaten metro |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/may/14/italy.artnews |work=[[The Guardian|Guardian]] |date=14 May 2007 |accessdate=10 August 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first section is due to open in 2011 and the final sections in 2015, but archaeological findings often delay underground construction work. A fourth line, D line, is also planned. It will have 22 stations over a distance of {{convert|20|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. The first section is projected to open in 2015 and the final sections before 2035.

Above-ground public transport in Rome is made up of a bus, tram and urban train network (FR lines). The bus and tram network is run by ''Trambus S.p.A.'' under the auspices of ''Atac S.p.A.'' (which originally stood for the Municipal Bus and Tramways Company, ''Azienda Tramvie e Autobus del Comune'' in Italian). The bus network has in excess of 350 bus lines and over 8 thousand bus stops, whereas the more-limited tram system has 39&amp;nbsp;km of track and 192 stops.&lt;ref&gt;The figures are from the ATAC [http://www.atac.roma.it/index.asp?p=2&amp;i=616&amp;o=3&amp;m=1&amp;a=7&amp;ci=45&amp;tpg=2&amp;lingua=ITA website] {{it icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also one [[trolleybus]] line, opened in 2005, and additional trolleybus lines are planned.&lt;ref name=&quot;juts2009&quot;&gt;Webb, Mary (ed.)

==International entities, organisations and involvement==
[[File:FAO sede.jpg|thumb|[[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] headquarters in Rome]]

Rome is unique in having a sovereign state located entirely within its city limits, the Vatican City. The Vatican is a enclave of Rome and a sovereign possession of the [[Holy See]], the supreme government of the Roman Catholic Church. Rome hosts foreign embassies to both Italy and the Holy See, although frequently the same ambassador is accredited to both.

Another body, the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] (SMOM), took refuge in Rome in 1834, due to the conquest of Malta by [[Napoleon]] in 1798. It is sometimes classified as having sovereignty but does not claim any territory in Rome or anywhere else, hence leading to dispute over its actual sovereign status.

Rome is also the seat of international agencies of the [[United Nations]], such as the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP), the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), and the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD).

Rome has traditionally been involved in the process of European political integration. In 1957, the city hosted the signing of the [[Treaties of Rome|Treaty of Rome]], which established the [[European Economic Community]] (predecessor to the [[European Union]]), and also played host to the official signing of the proposed [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] in July 2004.

Rome is the seat of the [[NATO Defense College]] and is the place where the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Statute of the International Criminal Court]] was formulated.

<text>
[[File:Maison punique byrsa.jpg|thumb|right|District of Punic Byrsa]]'''Byrsa''' was the walled [[citadel]] above the harbour in ancient [[Carthage]]. It was also the name of the hill it rested on.  The name is derived from the [[Phoenician languages|Phoenician]] word for ''citadel''.
In [[Virgil]]'s account of [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]]'s founding of [[Carthage]], when Dido and her party were encamped at Byrsa, the local Berber chieftain offered them as much land as could be covered with a single oxhide. Therefore, Dido cut an oxhide into tiny strips and set them on the ground end to end until she had completely encircled Byrsa. This story is considered apocryphal, and was most likely invented because ''Byrsa'' sounds similar to the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''?????'', meaning ''oxhide''.

The citadel dominated the city below and formed the principal military installation of Carthage. It was besieged by [[Scipio Aemilianus Africanus]] in the [[Third Punic War]] and was defeated and destroyed in [[146 BC]].

[[Image:Mozia (posizione).png|right|thumb|Position of Motya]]'''Motya''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{polytonic|?????, ?????}}; [[Italian language|Italian]]: [[Mozia]] ot Mothia; [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]: Mozzia), was an ancient and powerful city on an island off the west coast of [[Sicily]], between Drepanum (modern [[Trapani]]) and Lilybaeum (modern [[Marsala]]). &lt;!-- (formerly San Pantaleo, now called [[Mozia]] after the ancient city)  is not correct - the original name is &quot;Motya&quot; because in times BC there was no Christian name like &quot;San Pantaleo&quot; --&gt;The eponymous (in ancient times) island renamed ''San Pantaleo'' in the 11th century by [[Basilian monk]]s is situated in a lagoon on the most western part of Sicily (nearly 850 metres long and 750 metres wide) about one km (six [[Ancient Greek units of measurement#Length|stadia]]) from the mainland of Sicily, to which it was joined by an artificial causeway (paved road), by which [[chariot]]s with large wheels could reach the town.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus]] xiv. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
[[File:Motya from above artistic reconstruction 1 0.jpg|thumb|400 px|The city at V century b.C.]]
The foundation of the city probably dates from the [[8th century BC|8th century BCE]], about a century after the foundation of Carthage in Tunisia. It was originally a colony of the [[Phoenicians]], who were fond of choosing similar sites, and probably in the first instance merely a commercial station or emporium, but gradually rose to be a flourishing and important town. The [[ancient Greece|Greeks]], however, according to their custom, assigned it a legendary origin, and derived its name from a woman named &quot;Motya&quot;, whom they connected with the fables concerning [[Herakles]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]] ''s. v.''&lt;/ref&gt; According to coin finds the name &quot;Motya&quot; is derived from [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] &quot;Mtw&quot; and is said to mean &quot;wool-spinning center&quot;. It passed, in common with the other Phoenician settlements in Sicily, at a later period under the government or dependency of [[Carthage]], whence Diodorus calls it a Carthaginian colony; but it is probable that this is not strictly correct. &lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]] vi. 2 ; Diod. xiv. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Greek colonies in Sicily increased in numbers and importance the Phoenicians gradually abandoned their settlements in the immediate neighbourhood of the newcomers, and concentrated themselves in the three principal colonies of [[Solus]], Panormus (modern [[Palermo]]), and Motya. &lt;ref&gt;Thuc. ''l. c.''&lt;/ref&gt; The last of these, from its proximity to Carthage and its opportune situation for communication with [[Africa]], as well as the natural strength of its position, became one of the chief strongholds of the Carthaginians, as well as one of the most important of their commercial cities in the island.&lt;ref&gt;Diod. xiv. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears to have held, in both these respects, the same position which was attained at a later period by Lilybaeum.

Notwithstanding these accounts of its early importance and flourishing condition, the name of Motya is rarely mentioned in history until just before the period of its memorable siege. It is first mentioned by [[Hecataeus]], &lt;ref&gt;''ap.'' Steph. B. ''s. v.''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thucydides]] notices it among the chief colonies of the Phoenicians in Sicily, which still subsisted at the period of the [[Athens|Athenian]] expedition, 415 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Thuc. vi. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later (409 BCE) when the Carthaginian army under [[Hannibal Mago]] landed at the promontory of Lilybaeum, that general laid up his fleet for security in the gulf around Motya, while he advanced with his land forces along the coast to attack [[Selinus]].&lt;ref&gt; Diod. xiii. 54, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the latter city, we are told that [[Hermocrates]], the [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracusan]] exile, who had established himself on its ruins with a numerous band of followers, laid waste the territories of Motya and Panormus;&lt;ref&gt; ''Id.'' xiii. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; and again during the second expedition of the Carthaginians under [[Hamilcar]] (407 BCE), these two cities became the permanent station of the Carthaginian fleet.&lt;ref&gt; ''Id.'' xiii. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the important position to which Motya had thus attained that led [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]] to direct his principal efforts to its reduction, when in 397 BCE he in his turn invaded the Carthaginian territory in Sicily. The citizens on the other hand, relying on succour from Carthage, made preparations for a vigorous resistance; and by cutting off the causeway which united them to the mainland, compelled Dionysius to have recourse to the tedious and laborious process of constructing a mound or mole of earth across the intervening space. Even when this was accomplished, and the military engines of Dionysius (among which the formidable [[catapult]] on this occasion made its appearance for the first time) were brought up to the walls, the Motyans continued a desperate resistance; and after the walls and towers were carried by the overwhelming forces of the enemy, still maintained the defence from street to street and from house to house. This obstinate struggle only increased the previous exasperation of the Sicilian Greeks against the Carthaginians; and when at length the troops of Dionysius made themselves masters of the city, they put the whole surviving population, men, women, and children, to the sword.&lt;ref&gt;Diod. xiv. 47-53.&lt;/ref&gt; After this the Syracusan despot placed it in charge of a garrison under an officer named [[Biton of Syracuse|Biton]]; while his brother [[Leptines of Syracuse|Leptines]] made it the station of his fleet. But the next spring (396 BCE) [[Himilcon]], the Carthaginian general, having landed at Panormus with a very large force, recovered possession of Motya with comparatively little difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Motya, however, was not destined to recover its former importance; for Himilcon, being apparently struck with the superior advantages of Lilybaeum, founded a new city on the promontory of that name, to which he transferred the few remaining inhabitants of Motya.&lt;ref&gt;Diod. xxii. 10. p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt; From this period the latter altogether disappears from history; and the little islet on which it was built, has probably ever since, as now, been inhabited only by a few fishermen. By the time the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] conquered Sicily, during the [[First Punic War]] (264&amp;ndash;241 BCE), Motya had been eclipsed by Lilybaeum.
Image:Mozia,_cothon.jpg|

It is a singular fact that, though we have no account of Motya having received any Greek population, or fallen into the hands of the Greeks before its conquest by Dionysius, there exist coins of the city with the Greek legend &quot;????????&quot;. They are, however, of great rarity, and are apparently imitated from those of the neighboring city of [[Segesta]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eckhel]], vol. i. p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current situation==
The site of Motya, on which earlier geographers were in much doubt, has been clearly identified and described by [[William Henry Smyth]]. Between the promontory of Lilybaeum (Capo Bo?o) and that of [[Aegithallus]] (San Teodoro), the coast forms a deep bight, in front of which lies a long group of low rocky islets, called the [[Stagnone]]. Within these, and considerably nearer to the mainland, lies the small island formerly called San Pantaleo, on which the remains of an ancient city may still be distinctly traced. Fragments of the walls,, with those of two gateways, still exist, and coins as well as pieces of ancient brick and pottery &amp;ndash; the never failing indications of an ancient site &amp;ndash; were found scattered throughout the island. The circuit of the latter does not exceed 2.5 km, and it is inhabited only by a few fishermen; but is not devoid of fertility.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Henry Smyth]], ''Sicily'', pp. 235, 236.&lt;/ref&gt; The confined space on which the city was built agrees with the description of Diodorus that the houses were lofty and of solid construction, with narrow streets ({{polytonic|????????}}) between them, which facilitated the desperate defence of the inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Diod. xiv. 48, 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
In March 2006, archaeological digs uncovered rooms of a previously undiscovered house at one of the town's siege walls. The finds have shown that the town had a &quot;thriving population long after it is commonly believed to have been destroyed by the Ancient Greeks.&quot; Discovered items include cooking pans, Phoenician-style vases, altars, and looms. &lt;ref&gt;[http://ansa.it/main/notizie/awnplus/english/news/2006-03-14_1147482.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Modern Fiction==

The 399 BC Battle of Motya, part of the war of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]]'s [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]]'s tyrant [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysios I]] against [[Carthage]] is a major event in the 1965 [[historical novel]] &quot;[[The Arrows of Hercules]]&quot; by [[L. Sprague de Camp]].

Shofet
</title>
<id>

</id>
<text>
In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and several other [[Semitic languages]], '''shofet''' (plural '''shoftim''') literally means &quot;Judge&quot;, from the verb &quot;?-P-T&quot;, &quot;to pass judgment&quot;. Cognate titles exist in other Semitic cultures, notably Phoenicia.==Hebrew==
{{main|Biblical judges}}
In the Bible, the shoftim were [[tribal chief|chieftain]]s who united various [[Israelite]] tribes in time of mutual danger to defeat foreign enemies. See [[Book of Judges]] for more details.

==Punic==
In the various independent city states constituting [[Phoenicia]] proper (coasts of present Lebanon and Syria) and its &quot;Punic&quot; Mediterranean colonies a shofet (in [[Punic language|Punic]], '''''suffet''''' or '''''suffete''''') was a non-royal magistrate granted control over a city-state, sometimes functioning much in the same way as a [[Roman republic|Roman]] [[consul]].

The term is mostly widely known from the suffetes of [[Carthage]], a former Phoenician colony.  Following the overthrow of its monarchy in the [[400s&amp;nbsp;BC]], Carthage was ruled by a number of aristocratic councils presided over by two suffetes, who served in similar capacity to Roman consuls.

'''Kerkouane''' ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;??????&lt;/big&gt;}}; occasionally '''Kerkuane''') is a [[Punic]] city in northeastern [[Tunisia]], near [[Cape Bon]]. This [[Phoenicia]]n city was probably abandoned during the [[First Punic War]] (c. 250 B.C.), and as a result was not rebuilt by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. It had existed for almost 400 years.

Excavations of the town have revealed ruins from the 4th and 3rd Centuries [[Anno Domini|BC]]. Around the site where the layout is clearly visible, many houses still show their walls, and the coloured clay on the facades is often still visible. The houses were built to a standard plan, in accordance with a sophisticated notion of town planning.

A sanctuary has some columns preserved, and in a small atrium parts of mosaics are found. Curbstones, doorsteps, thresholds, and floors of simple mosaic layers are found all over the ruins. Still archaeologists work on the Kerkouane site, but it is believed that the best parts have already been discovered.

Kerkouane was one of the most important Punic cities, with [[Carthage]], [[Hadrumetum]] (modern [[Sousse]]) and [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]].

==Sights==

[[UNESCO]] declared the [[Carthage|Punic]] Town of Kerkouane and its [[Necropolis of Kerkouane|Necropolis]] a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1985, citing among other things that the remains constitute the only example of a Phoenicio-Punic city to have survived.

'''Saint Louis Cathedral''' ({{lang-fr|La cath?drale Saint-Louis de Carthage}}) is an old [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[cathedral]] located in [[Carthage]], [[Tunisia]].

Situated on the peak of Byrsa Hill and near the ruins of the ancient [[Punic]] and then [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city, the cathedral is no longer used for worship but hosts concerts of [[Music of Tunisia|Tunisian music]] and [[classical music]]. The only Roman Catholic cathedral operating in Tunisia is now the [[Cathedral of St. Vincent de Paul]] in Tunis.

== History ==
[[Al-Husayn II ibn Mahmud|Hussein II Bey]] authorised the French consul-general to build a cathedral on the site of ancient Carthage, to determine where it would be situated and to take all the land necessary for the project. His words were:

{{quotation|Praise to the one God, to whom all things return!&lt;br&gt;
We cede in perpetuity to His Majesty the [[List of French monarchs|King of France]] a location in the Malka, sufficient to raise a religious monument in honour of King [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] at the place where this prince died.&lt;ref&gt;In 1270, the [[Eighth Crusade]] arrived before [[Tunis]]. Hoping to convert the Sultan of Tunis to [[Christianity]] and use him to fight against the Sultan of [[Egypt]], the crusaders easily took Carthage but the army was struck by an epidemic of [[dysentery]]. Louis IX (Saint Louis) died on 25 August. Part of his remains were buried in Tunisia; the tomb containing them can be visited today.&lt;/ref&gt; We commit ourselves to respect and to make respected this monument consecrated by the King of France to the memory of one of his most illustrious ancestors. Greetings from the servant of God, Hussein Pasha Bey. May the Most High be propitious! Amen.&lt;br&gt;
The 17th of [[Safar]] of the year 1246. Done at [[Le Bardo|Bardo]] the 8th of August 1830. For the consul-general Mathieu de Lesseps.}}

The consul charged his son Jules with this duty. The latter, having closely examined possible sites, concluded that the chapel ought to be built on Byrsa Hill, in the centre of the Punic acropolis, where the temple of [[Asclepius|Aesculapius]] was once located. [[Louis-Philippe of France|King Louis-Philippe]] approved the project. The architect chosen conceived a building of modest proportions that contained a mix of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] styles. In any case, he succeeded in giving it the look of a rich [[marabout]] while recalling the royal chapel at [[Dreux]]. A cross, the only one standing at that time in Tunisia, topped the building.&lt;ref&gt;Mgr Alexandre Pons, ''La nouvelle ?glise d'Afrique ou le catholicisme en Alg?rie, en Tunisie et au Maroc depuis 1830''. ed. Librairie Louis Namura, [[Tunis]], 1930&lt;/ref&gt; Descendants of crusaders' families, companions of the sovereign, helped finance the construction.

[[File:St Louis Cathedral - Carthage - Tunisia - 1899.jpg|thumb|left|St. Louis Cathedral in 1899]]
Built between 1884 and 1890, under the [[French protectorate in Tunisia|French protectorate]], the cathedral acquired [[Primate (religion)|primacy]] for all of [[Africa]] when the title of primate of Africa was restored for the benefit of [[Charles Lavigerie|Cardinal Lavigerie]], titular of the Archdioceses of [[Algiers]] and of [[Patriarchate of Carthage|Carthage]], united in his person. The building was consecrated with great pomp in the presence of numerous ecclesiastical dignitaries.&lt;ref&gt;For this occasion, some relics of Saint Louis kept in [[Sicily]] were brought by the Archbishop of [[Palermo]] for, before Saint Louis' body could be brought back to France, problems conserving it made it necessary for his innards to be left in Sicily. When Tunisia became independent, these relics were taken to France and deposited in [[Sainte-Chapelle]].&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death, Cardinal Lavigerie was buried there and a funerary monument was erected in his memory. However, his body now lies in the Catholic cemetery of [[Bayonne]], on the right bank of the [[Adour]], near the Jewish cemetery.

== Architecture ==
Late 19th century French architecture tended to feature composite styles (as in the case of the [[Basilica of the Sacr? C?ur]] in [[Paris]], built in a Roman-Byzantine style in the same era). The building, constructed according to the plans of the abbot Pougnet, has a Byzantine-Moorish style, and is in the shape of a Latin cross of 65 meters by 30. The fa?ade is framed by two square towers, the [[Crossing (architecture)|crossing]] lies beneath a large [[cupola]] surrounded by eight little steeples, and there is a smaller cupola above the [[apse]]. The church contains a [[nave]] and two [[aisle]]s separated by [[arch]]es passing above and the ceiling is adorned with beams that have sculpted, painted and gilt [[Arabesque (European art)|arabesque]]s on them. The [[stained glass]] also features arabesques. The great bell weighs six tons and there is a four-bell [[carillon]] as well.

Carthago delenda est

[[Image:Marco_Porcio_Caton_Major.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cato the Elder]].]][[File:Carthage location 2.png|thumb|The location of Carthage in North Africa.]][[File:Carthage villas-romaines 1950.jpg|thumb|right|The ruins of Roman Carthage]]
'''&quot;Carthago delenda est&quot;''' ([[English language|English]]: &quot;[[Carthage]] must be destroyed&quot;) or the fuller '''&quot;Ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam&quot;''' or '''&quot;Ceterum autem censeo Carthaginem esse delendam&quot;''' (English: &quot;Furthermore, I think Carthage must be destroyed&quot;) are [[List of Latin phrases|Latin political phrases]] which were popular in the [[Roman Republic]] during the latter years of the [[Punic Wars]] against [[Carthage]]. The city was indeed finally razed by the Romans after the [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|Battle of Carthage]] in 146 BC, and its entire remaining population sold into [[slavery]].

Although no ancient source gives the phrase exactly as it is usually quoted in modern times (either ''Carthago delenda est'' or the fuller ''Ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam''),  according to several ancient sources   the Roman statesman [[Cato the Elder]] would always end his speeches with some variation of this expression even if he had not been discussing Carthage in the speech.&lt;ref&gt;Charles E. Little, &quot;[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0009-8353%28193403%2929%3A6%3C429%3ATAAFOC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-O The Authenticity and Form of Cato's Saying 'Carthago Delenda Est,']&quot; ''Classical Journal'' 29 (1934), pp. 429-435.  The main ancient sources are [[Plutarch]], ''[[Parallel Lives|Cato]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cato_Major*.html#27 27] ({{polytonic|????? ?? ??? ??? ????????? ?? ?????}}); [[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|NH]]'' 15.74; [[Florus]] [http://thelatinlibrary.com/florus1.html#31 1.31]; [[Aurelius Victor]] ''De viris illustribus'' 47.8.  (The evolution of the phrasing towards its modern form has been further considered in Silvia Th?rlemann-Rapperswil, &quot;'Ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam,'&quot; ''Gymnasium'' 81 (1974).)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Romans were successful in the first two Punic Wars, as they vied for dominance with the seafaring [[Phoenicia]]n city-state of Carthage in [[North Africa]] (modern day [[Tunisia]]), they suffered a number of humiliations and damaging reverses, especially at the [[Battle of Cannae]] (216 BC). This grew into an attitude of seeking vengeance and total victory, which was expressed with these phrases.
The attitude of total warfare toward Carthage resulted in the utter destruction of the city at the end of the [[Third Punic War]] and the surviving inhabitants were sold into slavery. The modern legend that the city was [[salting the earth|sown with salt]] reflects the perceived savagery of destruction.

The phrase is sometimes adapted in modern usage, in a learned reference to total warfare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ancienthistory.about.com/b/a/129595.htm &quot;Delenda est&quot; shouldn't be destroyed&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The English minister [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley Cooper (Earl of Shaftesbury)]] revived the phrase (rendered as &quot;Delenda est Carthago&quot;) in a famous 1673 speech before Parliament during the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]], comparing England to Rome and the Dutch Republic to Carthage. [[Ben Klassen]], the founder of the anti-Semitic [[Creativity (religion)|Church of the Creator]], adopted the phrase for his movement, modifying it to &quot;Delenda est Judaica&quot;, &quot;Death to Judaism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;G. Michael,= (2009) ''Theology of Hate: A History of the World Church of Creation'' (University of Florida Press) p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  The original phrase was again used as the title for [[Alan Wilkins (playwright)|Alan Wilkins]]' 2007 play on the Third Punic War.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.traverse.co.uk/show_detail.php?id=432 Traverse Theatre website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another, less martial, use is to affirm the correctness of one's opinion about a necessary course of action by adding either at the beginning or the end of a statement the two words &quot;Ceterum censeo&quot;. It bears some (self)irony indicating that the action has been proposed since ancient time, is still valid and has not yet been acted upon.

==Grammar==
Grammatically it expresses necessity by using a [[Gerundive#In Latin|gerundive]] with a form of the verb ''[[wikt:sum#Latin|esse]]'' &quot;to be&quot;. The fuller form ''Ceterum censeo ?'' uses the so-called [[accusative and infinitive]] for the indirect statement. This construction in Latin is known as the [[passive periphrastic]].

'''Termini Imerese'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]: '''''T?rmini'''''; [[Greek language|Greek]]: '''Thermae Himeraeae''' - {{lang|grc|??????}}; {{lang|grc|?????? ?? ???????}}, [[Polybius|Pol.]]; {{lang|grc|?????? ??????}}, [[Ptolemy|Ptol.]]; {{lang|grc|?????}}, {{lang|grc|????? ???????}}, [[Diodorus|Diod.]], [[Latin]]: '''Thermae Himerenses''', literally [[Himera]]'s hot springs&lt;/ref&gt; is a town and ''[[comune]]'' in the province of [[Palermo]] on the northern coast of [[Sicily]], southern [[Italy]].

==History==
===Ancient===
The site where the town now sits has been populated since prehistoric times, as many archeologial excavations have shown through the years. Nevertheless, it might be stated that its recorded history started in [[409 BC]] when its more ancient neighbor, [[Himera]] (now completely within the comune's borders), was completely destroyed by the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] army under [[Hannibal Mago]]. Those who survived the devastation promptly repaired to a site then called &quot;Thermae&quot; - the name deriving from the hot springs - which is today known as Termini; and the ancients considered Thermae as a successor to Himera.  The new town of Thermae or Therma, called for the sake of distinction Thermae Himerenses, which thus took the place of Himera, obviously derived its name from the hot springs for which it was celebrated, and the first discovery of which was connected by legends with the wanderings of [[Hercules]].&lt;ref&gt;Diod. iv. 23, v. 3; [[Pindar|Pind.]] ''Ol.'' xii. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears to have early become a considerable town, though it continued, with few and brief exceptions, to be subject to the Carthaginian rule. In the [[First Punic War]] its name is repeatedly mentioned. Thus, in [[260 BC]], a body of [[ancient Rome|Roman]] troops were encamped in the neighborhood, when they were attacked by [[Hamilcar]], and defeated with heavy loss.&lt;ref&gt;Pol. i. 24; Diod. xxiii. 9. Exc. H. p.&amp;nbsp;503.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the close of the war, Thermae itself was besieged and taken by the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;Pol. i. 39; Diod. xxiii. 20. Exc. H. p.&amp;nbsp;506.&lt;/ref&gt; We have, however, no clue to the circumstances which led to the peculiar favor which this city seems to have received at the hands of its Roman conquerors. [[Cicero]] tells us that the Roman government restored to the Thermitani their city and territory, with the free use of their own laws, as a reward for their steady fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;Cic. ''Verr.'' ii: 37&lt;/ref&gt; As we see that they were on hostile terms with Rome during the First Punic War, it can only be to the subsequent period that these expressions apply; but the occasion to which they refer is unknown. In the time of Cicero, Thermae appears to have been a flourishing place, carrying on a considerable amount of trade, though the orator speaks, of it as ''oppidum non maximum''.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' ii. 46, 75, iii. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems to have received a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]] in the time of [[Augustus]], whence we find mention in inscriptions of the ''Ordo et Populus splendidissimae Coloniae Augustae Himeraeorum Thermitanorum''&lt;ref&gt;Castell. ''Inscr. Sicil.'' p.&amp;nbsp;47; Gruter. ''Inscr.'' p.&amp;nbsp;433, no. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;: and there can be very little doubt that the Thermae ''colonia'' of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] in reality refers to this town, though he evidently understood it to be Thermae Selinuntiae (modern [[Sciacca]]), as he places it on the south coast between Agrigentum (modern [[Agrigento]]) and [[Selinus]]&lt;ref&gt;Plin. iii. 8. s. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; There are little subsequent account of Thermae; but, as its name is found in [[Ptolemy]] and the Itineraries, it appears to have continued in existence throughout the period of the [[Roman Empire]], and probably never ceased to be inhabited, as the modern town of Termini Imerese retains the ancient site as well as name.&lt;ref&gt;Ptol. iii. 4. ? 4; [[Antonine Itinerary|Itin. Ant.]] p.&amp;nbsp;92; [[Tabula Peutingeriana]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The magnificence of the ancient city, and the taste of its citizens for the encouragement of art, are attested by Cicero, who calls it ''in primis Siciliae clarum et ornatum''; and some evidence of it remained, even in the days of that orator, in the statues preserved by the Thermitani, to whom they had been restored by Scipio, after the conquest of Carthage.&lt;ref&gt;Cic. ''Verr.'' ii. 3. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages and modern===

With the fall of the Roman Empire began a period of decadence of the town.  Terme bishop's seat was up to the twelfth century, although the number of bishops has several gaps and uncertainties.  During the domain Norman city became director and later joined the city-owned.  Especially from the Middle Ages until the early nineteenth century was one of the largest centers for collecting and loading of grain and other foodstuffs that were stored and subject to duty in special stores (Royal Charger).  The presence of the shipper had the good fortune of the town that became a major Sicilian port and had intense trade relations with the [[Italian maritime republics]]&lt;ref&gt;Contino &amp; Mantia, 1997.1998, 2001 a, b; 2002nd, b, 2003, 2004, the 2005th, b , c&lt;/ref&gt; of Genoa, Pisa and Venice and the major Mediterranean ports (Marseille, Barcelona etc.) and also in the sixteenth century Atlantic.  At the end of the eighteenth century was the seat of the section of the Ereina Imerese Ereina of Palermo and shortly after Euracea dell'Accademia. In the nineteenth century the closure of Charity Grain was the beginning of a deep economic crisis that narrowed at the end of the century when it developed skills and protoindustriali.  The population decline, mainly related to migration to the Americas, was compensated at the beginning of the twentieth century by immigration from Agrigento, from Messina and Ragusa.

Since 1970, Termini Imerese hosts a large [[Fiat]] automobile manufacturing facility, where Fiat's small cars such as the [[Fiat 126]], the original [[Fiat Panda]] as well as the [[Fiat Punto]] have been manufactured. Since 2005, the plant is the sole assembly site for the [[Lancia Ypsilon]], and in 2006 such a vehicle became the four-millionth one to be produced there.[http://www.samar.pl/__/__la/en/__ac/sec,4/new/9694/__Four-million-cars-manufactured-at-Fiat-Termini-Imerese-plant.html] By the end of 2011, Fiat sold the plant to Chinese car manufacturer Chery &lt;ref&gt;{{Internetquelle | url=http://motoring.asiaone.com/Motoring/News/Story/A1Story20120221-329290.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a power station operated by Enel with a generation capacity of 454 MW.

[[Image:Sicily Selinunte Temple E (Hera).JPG|thumb|275px|The Temple of Hera, also known as &quot;Temple E,&quot; at Selinunte.]][[File:Marinella-di-Selinunte-bjs-1.jpg|thumb| Selinunte.]]'''Selinunte''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|????????}}; [[Latin]]: '''Selinus''') is an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[archaeology|archaeological]] site on the south coast of [[Sicily]], southern [[Italy]], between the valleys of the rivers [[Belice]] and [[Modione]] in the [[province of Trapani]]. The archaeological site contains five temples centered on an [[acropolis]]. Of the five temples, only the Temple of Hera, also known as &quot;Temple E&quot;, has been re-erected.

==History==
[[File:Selinos didrachm ANS 685 670331.jpg|thumb|Selinunte [[didrachm]] coin bearing a ''selinon'' (celery) leaf, circa 515?470 BC.]]

Selinunte was one of the most important of the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] colonies in Sicily, situated on the southwest coast of that island, at the mouth of the small river of the same name, and 6.5&amp;nbsp;km west of that of the Hypsas (the modern [[Belice River]]). It was founded, according to historian [[Thucydides]], by a colony from the Sicilian city of Megara, or [[Megara Hyblaea]], under the conduct of a leader named [[Pammilus]], about 100 years after the settlement of that city, with the addition of a fresh body of colonists from the parent city of [[Megara]] in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides vi. 4, vii. 57; [[Scymnus]] 292; [[Strabo]] vi. p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; The date of its foundation cannot be precisely fixed, as Thucydides indicates it only by reference to that of the Sicilian Megara, which is itself not accurately known, but it may be placed about 628 BCE. [[Diodorus]] places it 22 years earlier, or 650 BCE, and [[Hieronymus]] still further back, 654 BCE. The date from Thucydides, which is probably the most likely, is incompatible with this earlier epoch.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides vi. 4; Diodorus Siculus xiii. 59; Hieronymus ''Chron.'' ad ann. 1362; Clinton, ''Fast. Hell.'' vol. i. p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; The name is supposed to have been derived from quantities of wild [[parsley]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|???????}}?''selinon'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dse%2Flinon ???????], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; that grew on the spot. For the same reason, they adopted the parsley leaf as the symbol on their coins.

Selinunte was the most westerly of the Greek colonies in Sicily, and for this reason was early brought into contact and collision with the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] and the native Sicilians in the west and northwest of the island. The former people, however, do not at first seem to have offered any obstacle to their progress; but as early as 580 BCE we find the Selinuntines engaged in hostilities with the people of [[Segesta]] (a non-Hellenic city), whose territory bordered on their own.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus v. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The arrival of a body of emigrants from [[Rhodes]] and [[Cnidus]] who subsequently founded [[Lipara]], and who lent their assistance to the Segestans, for a time secured the victory to that people; but disputes and hostilities seem to have been of frequent occurrence between the two cities, and it is probable that in 454 BCE, when Diodorus speaks of the Segestans as being at war with the [[Marsala|Lilybaeans]] (modern Marsala),&lt;ref&gt;xi. 86&lt;/ref&gt; that the Selinuntines are the people really meant. The river [[Mazarus]], which at that time appears to have formed the boundary between the two states, was only about 25&amp;nbsp;km west of Selinunte; and it is certain that at a somewhat later period the territory of Selinunte extended to its banks, and that that city had a fort and emporium at its mouth&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xiii. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side its territory certainly extended as far as the [[Halycus]] (modern [[Platani]]), at the mouth of which it founded the colony of [[Heraclea Minoa|Minoa]], or Heracleia, as it was afterward termed&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]] v. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; It is evident, therefore, that Selinunte had early attained to great power and prosperity; but we have very little information as to its history. We learn, however, that, like most of the Sicilian cities, it had passed from an oligarchy to a despotism, and about 510 BCE was subject to a despot named [[Peithagoras]], from whom the citizens were freed by the assistance of the [[Sparta]]n [[Euryleon]], one of the companions of [[Dorieus]]: and thereupon Euryleon himself, for a short time, seized on the vacant sovereignty, but was speedily overthrown and put to death by the Selinuntines.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus v. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The causes leading the Selinuntines to abandon the cause of the other Greeks, and take part with the Carthaginians during the great expedition of [[Hamilcar]] (480 BCE) are unknown; they had even promised to send a contingent to the Carthaginian army, which, however did not arrive till after its defeat&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xi. 21, xiii. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Selinunte - Tempio E.JPG|thumb|left|&quot;Temple E&quot;]]
The Selinuntines are next mentioned in 466 BCE, as co-operating with the other free cities of Sicily in assisting the [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracusans]] to expel [[Thrasybulus of Syracuse|Thrasybulus]];&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' xi. 68&lt;/ref&gt; and there is every reason to suppose that they fully shared in the prosperity of the half century that followed, a period of tranquility and opulence for most of the Greek cities in Sicily. Thucydides speaks of Selinunte just before the [[Athens|Athenian]] expedition as a powerful and wealthy city, possessing great resources for war both by land and sea, and having large stores of wealth accumulated in its temples.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides vi. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Diodorus also represents it at the time of the Carthaginian invasion, as having enjoyed a long period of tranquility, and possessing a numerous population.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xiii. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 416 BCE, a renewal of the old disputes between Selinunte and Segesta became the occasion of the great Athenian expedition to Sicily. The Selinuntines were the first to call in the powerful aid of Syracuse, and thus for a time obtained the complete advantage over their enemies, whom they were able to blockade both by sea and land; but in this extremity the Segestans had recourse to the assistance of Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides vi. 6; Diodorus Siculus xii. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Athenians do not appear to have taken any measures for the immediate relief of Segesta, it is probable that the Selinuntines and Syracusans withdrew their forces at once, as we hear no more of their operations against Segesta. Nor does Selinunte bear any important part in the war of which it was the immediate occasion. [[Nicias]] indeed proposed, when the expedition first arrived in Sicily (415 BCE); that they should proceed at once to Selinunte and compel that city to submit on moderate terms;&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides vi. 47&lt;/ref&gt; but this advice being overruled, the efforts of the armament were directed against Syracuse, and the Selinuntines in consequence bore but a secondary part in the subsequent operations. They are, however, mentioned on several occasions as furnishing auxiliaries to the Syracusans; and it was at Selinunte that the large [[Peloponnesia]]n force sent to the support of [[Gylippus]] landed in the spring of 413 BCE, having been driven over to the coast of Africa by a tempest.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides vii. 50, 58; Diodorus Siculus xiii. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat of the Athenian armament apparently left the Segestans at the mercy of their rivals. They tried in vain to ease Selinuntine hostility by ceding without further contest the frontier district that was the original subject of dispute. The Selinuntines, however, were not satisfied with this concession, and continued to press them with fresh aggressions, leading the Segestans to seek assistance from Carthage. After some hesitation, Carthage sent a small force, with the assistance of which the Segestans defeated the Selinuntines in a battle.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xiii. 43, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The Carthaginians in the following spring (409 BCE) sent over a vast army amounting, according to the lowest estimate, to 100,000 men, with which [[Hannibal Mago]] (the grandson of Hamilcar that was killed at [[Himera]]) landed at Lilybaeum, and from thence marched direct to Selinunte. The city's inhabitants had not expected such a force and were wholly unprepared to resist it. The city fortifications were, in many places, in disrepair, and the auxiliary force promised by Syracuse and Agrigentum (modern [[Agrigento]]) and [[Gela]], was not ready and did not arrive in time. The Selinuntines defended themselves with the courage of despair, and even after the walls were breached, continued the contest from house to house. However, the enemy's overwhelming numbers rendered resistance hopeless, and after a ten-day siege the city was taken and most of the defenders put to the sword. According to sources, of the citizens of Selinunte 16,000 were slain, 5,000 made prisoners, and 2,600 under the command of [[Empedion]] escaped to Agrigentum.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xiii. 54-59.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, Hannibal destroyed the city walls, but gave permission to the surviving inhabitants to return and occupy it as tributaries of Carthage, an arrangement confirmed by the treaty subsequently concluded between [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius]], tyrant of Syracuse, and the Carthaginians, in 405 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' xiii. 59, 114.&lt;/ref&gt; In the interval a considerable number of the survivors and fugitives had been brought together by [[Hermocrates]], and established within its walls.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' 63.&lt;/ref&gt; A considerable part of the citizens of Selinunte availed themselves of this permission, and that the city continued to subsist under the Carthaginian dominion; but a fatal blow had been given to its prosperity, which it undoubtedly never recovered.

The Selinuntines are again mentioned in 397 BCE as declaring in favor of Dionysius during his war with Carthage;&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xiv. 47&lt;/ref&gt; but both the city and territory were again given up to the Carthaginians by the peace of 383 BCE (''Id.'' xv. 17); and though Dionysius recovered possession of it by arms shortly before his death,&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' xv. 73&lt;/ref&gt; it is probable that it soon again lapsed under the dominion of Carthage. The Halycus, which was established as the eastern boundary of the Carthaginian dominion in Sicily by the treaty of 383 BCE, seems to have generally continued to be so recognized, notwithstanding temporary interruptions; and was again fixed as their limit by the treaty with [[Agathocles]] in 314 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' xix. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; This last treaty expressly stipulated that Selinunte, as well as Heracleia and Himera, should continue subject to Carthage, as before. In 276 BCE, however, during the expedition of [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] to Sicily, the Selinuntines voluntarily submitted to that monarch, after the capture of Heracleia.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' xxii. 10. Exc. H. p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[First Punic War]] we again find Selinunte subject to Carthage, and its territory was repeatedly the theater of military operations between the contending powers.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' xxiii. 1, 21; [[Polybius]] i. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; But before the close of the war (about 250 BCE), when the Carthaginians were beginning to contract their operations, and confine themselves to the defense of as few points as possible, they removed all the inhabitants of Selinunte to Lilybaeum and destroyed the city&lt;ref&gt;Diod. xxiv. 1. Exc. H. p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems certain that it was never rebuilt. [[Pliny the Elder]] indeed, mentions its name (''Selinus oppidum''&lt;ref&gt;iii. 8. s. 14&lt;/ref&gt;), as if it still existed as a town in his time, but [[Strabo]] distinctly classes it with extinct cities. [[Ptolemy]], though he mentions the river Selinus, has no notice of a town of the name.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo vi. p. 272; Ptolemy iii. 4. ? 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The Thermae Selinuntiae (at modern [[Sciacca]]), which derived their name from the ancient city, and seem to have been much frequented in the time of the [[ancient Rome|Romans]], were situated at a considerable distance, 30&amp;nbsp;km, from Selinunte: they are sulfurous springs, still much valued for their medical properties, and dedicated, like most thermal waters in Sicily, to San Calogero. At a later period they were called the Aquae Labodes or Larodes, under which name they appear in the Itineraries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antonine Itinerary]] p. 89; [[Tabula Peutingeriana]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern situation and ruins==
[[File:Koldewey-Sicilien-vol2-table15-detail01.png|thumb|Ground floor of Temple A (ca. 480 BC). The remains of the two spiral stairs between the [[pronaos]] and the [[cella]] are the oldest known to date (see [[List of ancient spiral stairs]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Temple A&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Beckmann|2002|p=354}}; {{harvnb|Ruggeri|2006|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

By the 19th century, the site of the ancient city was wholly desolate, with the exception of a solitary guardhouse, and the ground for the most part thickly overgrown with shrubs and low brushwood; but the remains of the walls could be distinctly traced throughout a great part of their circuit. They occupied the summit of a low hill, directly abutting on the sea, and bounded on the west by the marshy valley through which flows the river [[Madiuni]], the ancient Selinus; on the east by a smaller valley or depression, also traversed by a small marshy stream, which separates it from a hill of similar character, where the remains of the principal temples are still visible. The space enclosed by the existing walls is of small extent, so that it is probable the city in the days of its greatness must have covered a considerable area without them: and it has been supposed by some writers that the present line of walls is that erected by Hermocrates when he restored the city after its destruction by the Carthaginians.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus xiii. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; No trace is, however, found of a more extensive circuit, though the remains of two lines of wall, evidently connected with the port, are found in the small valley east of the city. Within the area surrounded by the walls are the remains of three temples, all of the [[Doric order]], and of an ancient style; none of them were standing until the temple designated &quot;Temple E&quot; was re-erected in the 20th century, but the foundations of them all remain, together with numerous portions of columns and other architectural fragments, sufficient to enable one to restore the plan and design of all three without difficulty. The largest of them is 70 m long by 25 m broad, and has 6 columns in front and 18 in length, a very unusual proportion. All these are [[hexastyle]] and [[peripteral]]. Besides these three temples there is a small temple or [[Aedicula]], of a different plan, but also of the Doric order. No other remains of buildings, beyond mere fragments and foundations, can be traced within the walls; but the outlines of two large edifices, built of squared stones and in a massive style, are distinctly traceable outside the walls, near the northeast and northwest angles of the city, though their nature or purpose is unclear.

But much the most remarkable of the ruins at Selinus are those of three temples on the hill to the east, which do not appear to have been included in the city, but, as was often the case, were built on this neighboring eminence, so as to front the city itself. All these temples are considerably larger than any of the three above described; and the most northerly of them is one of the largest of which we have any remains. It had 8 columns in front and 17 in the sides, and was of the kind called pseudo-dipteral. Its length was 110 m, and its breadth 55 m, so that it was actually longer than the great [[Temple of Olympian Zeus (Agrigento)|Temple of Olympian Zeus]] at Agrigentum, though not equal to it in breadth. From the columns being only partially fluted, as well as from other signs, it is clear that it never was completed; but all the more important parts of the structure were finished, and it must have certainly been one of the most imposing fabrics in antiquity. Only three of the columns are now standing, and these imperfect; but the whole area is filled up with a heap of fallen masses, portions of columns, capitals, and other huge architectural fragments, all of the most massive character, and forming, as observed by [[Henry Swinburne]], one of the most gigantic and sublime ruins imaginable. The two other temples are also prostrate, but the ruins have fallen with such regularity that the portions of almost every column lie on the ground as they have fallen; and it is not only easy to restore the plan and design of the two edifices, but it appears as if they could be rebuilt with little difficulty.

The southernmost of the three temples, the Temple of Hera, also known as &quot;Temple E,&quot; was reconstructed in the 20th century, as may be seen in the photographs below. A 1st century BC Greek inscription on the building records its dedication to Hera.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Spawforth, ''The Complete Greek Temples'' 2006, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

These temples, though greatly inferior to their gigantic neighbor, were still larger than that at Segesta, and even exceed the great temple of Neptune at [[Paestum]]; so that the three, when standing, must have presented a spectacle unrivaled in antiquity. All these buildings may be safely referred to a period anterior to the Carthaginian conquest (409 BCE), though the three temples last described appear to have been all of them of later date than those within the walls of the city. This is proved, among other circumstances, by the sculptured [[Metope (architecture)|metopes]], several of which have been discovered and extricated from among the fallen fragments. Those of these sculptures that belonged to the temples within the walls, present a peculiar and archaic style of art, and are universally recognized as among the earliest extant specimens of Greek sculpture&lt;ref&gt;They are figured by M?ller, ''Denkm?ler'', pl. 4, 5, as well as in many other works, and casts of them are in the [[British Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt; Those, on the contrary, which have been found among the ruins of the temple on the opposite hill, are of a later and more advanced style, though still retaining considerable remains of the stiffness of the earliest art. Besides the interest attached to these Selinuntine metopes from their important bearing on the history of Greek sculpture, the remains of these temples are of value as affording the most unequivocal testimony to the use of painting, both for the architectural decoration of the temples, and as applied to the sculptures with which they were adorned.

==Coinage==
The coins of Selinus are numerous and various. The earliest, as already mentioned, bear merely the figure of a parsley-leaf on the obverse. Those of somewhat later date represent a figure sacrificing on an altar, which is consecrated to [[Aesculapius]], as indicated by a cock that stands below it. The subject of this type evidently refers to a story related by [[Diogenes Laertius]]&lt;ref&gt;viii. 2. ? 11&lt;/ref&gt; that the Selinuntines were afflicted with a pestilence from the marshy character of the lands adjoining the neighboring river, but that this was cured by works of drainage, suggested by [[Empedocles]]. A figure standing on some coins is the river-god Selinus, who was thus made conducive to the salubrity of the city.

==How to get to Selinunte==

Highway A29 (Free) Palermo-Mazara del Vallo, exit Castelvetrano continuation Selinunte.

[[Trapani-Birgi Airport]], a military-civilian airport (with flights to the third traffic island). Recently the airport has seen an increase in flights due to low-cost flights from all parts of Europe (e.g. London-Stansted and London Luton Airport, Paris Beauvais, Dublin, Brussels, Munich, Frankfurt, Eindhoven, Stockholm).

{{About|the ancient city of Utica in Tunisia|other places with this name|Utica (disambiguation)}}[[File:TUNISIE UTIQUE 05.JPG|thumb|The ruins of Utica]]'''Utica''' ({{IPA-en|?jut?k?}}) is an ancient city northwest of [[Carthage]] near the outflow of the [[Medjerda River]] into the [[Mediterranean Sea]], traditionally considered to be the first colony founded by the Phoenicians in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Moscati, Sabatino. ''The World of the Phoenicians.'' New York: Frederick A. Praeger, Publishers, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, Utica no longer exists, and its remains are located not on the coast where it once lay, but further inland because deforestation and agriculture upriver led to massive erosion and the Medjerda River silted over its original mouth.&lt;ref&gt;?Utica (Utique) Tunisia&quot;.  The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites. Stillwell, Richard, Macdonald, William L. and McAllister, Marian Holland. Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press, 1976. 5 May 2007.  &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0006%3Aid%3Dutica&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Utica&quot; is from the Phoenician ''?attiq'' (identical to modern Arabic ??????? and Hebrew ????) meaning &quot;old [town]&quot;, contrasting with the later colony &quot;Carthage&quot;, meaning &quot;new town&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=91YymsCw5DIC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;dq=phoenician+%22old+town%22+utica&amp;source=web&amp;ots=sekC16vr4u&amp;sig=WKww_T6bMUOiMfL9x3LbtnGHlUo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;????????, &quot;????????&quot; (Polybius, &quot;Historiae&quot;, translated by: Beyamin Shimron [?????? ??????]; Bialik institute, Jerusalem 1991)p. 102, n. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Utica's beginnings===
Utica was founded as a port located on the trade route leading to the Straits of Gibraltar and the Atlantic, thus facilitating [[Phoenicia]]n trade in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aubet, Maria Eugenia 2001&quot;&gt;Aubet, Maria Eugenia. ''The Phoenicians and the West, Politics, Colonies, and Trade.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  The actual founding date of Utica is controversial. Several classical authors date its foundation around 1100 BC. The archaeological evidence, however, suggests a foundation no earlier than the eighth century BC. Although Carthage was later founded about 40&amp;nbsp;km. from Utica, records suggest ?that until 540 BC Utica was still maintaining political and economic autonomy in relation to its powerful Carthaginian neighbor?.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aubet, Maria Eugenia 2001&quot;/&gt;  By the fourth century BC, Utica came under Punic control but continued to exist as a privileged ally of Carthage.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. W. Walbank|Walbank, F. W.]], Astin, A.E., Frederiksen, M.W., Ogilvie R.M. and Drummond, A., eds. ''The Rise of Rome to 220 BC.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989. Vol. VII of The Cambridge Ancient History.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mercenary War===
This relationship between Carthage and Utica began to disintegrate after the [[First Punic War]], with the [[Mercenary War|outbreak of rebellion among mercenaries]] who had not received compensation for their service to Carthage. Originally, Utica refused to participate in this rebellion, so that the Libyan forces led by Spendius and Matho laid siege to Utica and nearby Hippocritae.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius.  ?The Histories.? Book 1. Loeb Classical Library. Vol I. 2 May 2007. &lt;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/1*.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The Carthaginian generals [[Hanno]] and [[Hamilcar]] then came to Utica's defense, managing to raise the siege, but &quot;the severest blow of all? was the defection of Hippacritae and Utica, the only two cities in [[Libya]] which had?bravely faced the present war?indeed they never had on any occasion given the least sign of hostility to Carthage.?  &lt;ref&gt;Polybius.  ?The Histories.? Book 1. Loeb Classical Library. Vol I. 2 May 2007. &lt;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/1*.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually, the forces of Carthage proved victorious, forcing Utica and Hippacritae to surrender after a short siege.&lt;ref&gt;Walbank, F.W., Astin, A.E., Frederiksen, M.W., Ogilvie R.M. and Drummond, A., eds. ''The Rise of Rome to 220 BC.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989. Vol. VII of The Cambridge Ancient History.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third Punic War===
Utica again defied Carthage in the [[Third Punic War]], when it surrendered to Rome shortly before the breakout of war in 150 BC. After its victory, Rome rewarded Utica by granting it an expanse of territory stretching from Carthage to [[Hippo Regius|Hippo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Walbank, F.W. 1989&quot;&gt;Walbank, F.W., Astin, A.E., Frederiksen, M.W., and Ogilvie R.M., eds. ''Rome and the Mediterranean to 133 BC.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989. Vol. VIII of The Cambridge Ancient History.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the war, Rome created a new province of [[Roman North Africa|Africa]], and Utica became its capital, which meant that the governor's residence was there along with a small garrison. Over the following decades Utica also attracted Roman citizens who settled there to do business.&lt;ref&gt;?Utica (Utique) Tunisia&quot;.  The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites. Stillwell, Richard, Macdonald, William L. and McAllister, Marian Holland. Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press, 1976. 5 May 2007.  &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0006%3Aid%3Dutica&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Civil War===
During the [[Caesar's civil war|Roman Civil War]] between the supporters of [[Pompey]] and [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], the remaining Pompeians, including [[Cato the Younger]], fled to Utica after being defeated at the [[Battle of Thapsus]] in 46 BC. Caesar pursued them to Utica, meeting no resistance from the inhabitants. Cato, who was the leader of the Pompeians, ensured the escape of his fellow senators and anyone else who desired to leave, then committed suicide, unwilling to accept the clemency of Caesar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walbank, F.W. 1989&quot;/&gt;  Displaying their fondness for Cato, ?the people of Utica...called Cato their saviour and benefactor... And this they continued to do even when word was brought that Caesar was approaching. They decked his body in splendid fashion, gave it an illustrious escort, and buried it near the sea, where a statue of him now stands, sword in hand?.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch.  ?The Parallel Lives.?  Loeb Classical Library. Vol VIII. 2 May 2007. &lt;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cato_Minor*.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  After his death, Cato was given the name of Uticensis, due to the place of his death as well as to his public glorification and burial by the citizens of Utica.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio.  ?Roman History.? Book 43. Loeb Classical Library. Vol IV 2 May 2007. &lt;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/43*.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman status===
Utica obtained the formal status of a [[municipium]] in 36 BC and its inhabitants became members of the tribe of Quirina.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Utica (Utique) Tunisia&quot;.  The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites. Stillwell, Richard, Macdonald, William L. and McAllister, Marian Holland. Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press, 1976. 5 May 2007.  &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0006%3Aid%3Dutica&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of [[Augustus]], however, the seat of provincial government was moved to Carthage, although Utica did not lose its status as one of the foremost cities in the province. When [[Hadrian]] was emperor, Utica requested to become a full Roman colony, but this request was not granted until [[Septimius Severus]], a native of the Province of Africa, took the throne.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bunson, Matthew. ?Utica.? Encyclopedia of the Roman Empire. New York: Facts on File, Inc., 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The fall of Utica===
In AD 439, the [[Vandals]] captured Utica, in AD 534 the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] captured it once more, and the Arabs were responsible for its ultimate destruction around AD 700.  &quot;Excavations at the site have yielded two Punic cemeteries and Roman ruins, including baths and a villa with mosaics&quot;.
&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Utica, Ancient City, N Africa&quot;. Columbia Encyclopedia. Academic Search Premier. EBSCOhost. Northwestern University Library. 1 May 2007.  &lt;http://web.ebscohost.com.turing.library.northwestern.edu/ehost/detail?vid=4&amp;hid=8&amp;sid=275d98f6-98aa-4c9b-8592-907b38a2c47c%40sessionmgr8&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ruins==
The site of the ruins of Utica is set on a low hill, composed of several Roman villas. Their walls still preserve decorative floor mosaics. To the northwest of these villas is a Punic necropolis, with Punic sarcophagi 20 feet (6meters) below the Roman level.
